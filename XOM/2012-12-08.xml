America became rich because big business capitalism replaced small business capitalism in the late 19th and early 20th century and then was inaugurated the technocrats' dream world of big business &amp; big government capitalism after World War II. Europe and Japan were already governed by technocrats when World War II ended. Things went well until the systems was hijacked by the laissez faire free marketers in the 1980s-2000s. They knew how to rig the system to make themselves rich, which is what they did, ignoring the cost for society. They did some damage in Europe but by far the larger amount of their influence, and the economic failure it wrought, was visited on the United States. They are still mostly in charge, although they did suffer a defeat this past November. A society dominated by technocrats is much more suited to dealing with high energy prices than one that is not. Indeed, such a society can actively profit from the inefficiency of other societies if they are not engineered to be efficient. Engineering a society to be efficient is really very straightforward. For the small businessmen and the speculator, or the banker, thinking in terms of systems and efficiency is effectively impossible. They lack the perspective or education for such thought. Designing cities, transportation systems, power grids, and education systems to achieve societal level efficiency takes quite some time, and it cannot be done unless the political systems is suited to. All the same, the world is being dominated by technocrats now. They are responsible for the much greater rate of natural resource extraction, industrial production, falling labor costs, and leaps in communications technology that are sweeping the globe... Those forces are deflationary, especially so in a place like the United States where most of the high costs that remain are an artifacts of a wasteful world of laissez faire fools, on their way out of power.</Msg><Username>greedful_thing_s</Username><Timestamp>1354983289694</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 11:14:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354987585708-6</Id><Topic><Title>O’Malley Reaches Out To Obama For Offshore Wind Support</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1354927903075</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-07 19:51:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another hand out for money we don't have so O'Malley can waste it and buy some votes.;</Msg><Username>infernalequinex</Username><Timestamp>1354987585708</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 12:26:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354988149170-7</Id><Title>Pilepsy at Exxon</Title><Msg>Exxon handcuffed and beat me while having a seizure in my office in the Exxon Building in Houston.

Many countries and environmentalists said the deal at the end of marathon two-week U.N. talks in OPEC-member Qatar would fail to slow rising temperatures or avert more floods, droughts, heatwaves and rising sea levels. Environment ministers extended until 2020 the Kyoto Protocol, which obliges about 35 industrialized nations to cut their greenhouse gas emissions until the end of 2012. That keeps the pact alive as the sole legally binding climate plan. But the 1997 treaty, 23 days away from expiry, has been sapped by the withdrawal of Russia, Japan and Canada and its remaining backers, led by the European Union and Australia, now account for just 15 percent of world greenhouse gas emissions. "Much, much more is needed if we are really going to address climate change and reduce emissions," said Kieren Keke, foreign minister of the Pacific island state of Nauru on behalf of the Alliance of Small Island States. He warned against endless talk that "locks in the death of our nations and of our children". Most nations favored keeping even a shrunken Kyoto as a blueprint for future action. "It was not an easy ride. It was not a beautiful ride. It was not a fast ride, but we managed to cross the bridge and hopefully we can increase our speed," European Climate Commissioner Connie Hedegaard said. CHINA, INDIA She said the deal would pave the way to talks on a new, global U.N. pact meant to be agreed in 2015 and enter into force in 2020, when Kyoto now expires. It will have emissions goals for all, including emerging nations led by China and India. U.N. Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon welcomed the deal but reckoned that "far more needs to be done," his spokesman said. Environmentalists were unimpressed by the set of deals called the "Doha Climate Gateway". "The U.N. climate talks failed to deliver increased cuts to carbon pollution, nor did they provide any credible pathway to $100 billion per year in finance by 2020 to help the poorest countries," the Climate Action Network-International said. "There's a huge disconnect between the urgency on the outside and what happens here," said Jennifer Haverkamp of the Environmental Defense Fund. The texts merely encouraged developed nations to raise aid from a current $10 billion a year from 2010-12 to help the poor cut emissions and adapt to a changing climate. Some major nations voiced objections as soon as the applause ended in the final plenary on Saturday night. U.S. Climate Envoy Todd Stern said Washington could not accept a reference to a 1992 U.N. climate Convention in one text. And Russia said it opposed the terms for extending the Kyoto Protocol beyond 2012. Russia wanted less stringent limits on unused carbon emissions permits, known as hot air. World carbon dioxide emissions are set to rise by 2.6 percent this year, and are about 58 percent higher than in 1990. Recent growth has come mostly from emerging nations, led by China and India. One decision raised the possibility of a new "mechanism" to help developing nations cope with losses and damage from everything from hurricanes to a creeping rise in sea levels. "Doha delivered just enough to keep the process moving. By resolving the key issues, all countries are now on a single track to enter into a new international climate agreement by 2015," said Jennifer Morgan of the World Resources Institute. Kyoto obliged about 35 industrialized nations to cut greenhouse gas emissions by an average of at least 5.2 percent below 1990 levels during the period from 2008 to 2012. The European Union, for instance, says it will deepen its cut to at least 20 percent below 1990 levels by 2020. Kyoto would have expired at the end of 2012 without an extension. The nations pulling out - Russia, Japan and Canada - say it is meaningless to take on new targets when emerging nations have none. And Washington never ratified the pact. reutersDOTcom/article/2012/12/08/us-climate-talks-idUSBRE8B60QU20121208</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355001889017</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 16:24:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1355009109958-12</Id><Topic><Title>The Gig Is Up At Fox</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1354675156682</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 21:39:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Everyone knows they and the Republicans hate the middle class and wants only to reduce them to serfdom while having them hand over their pay and their freedom to the wealthy Corporatists.

Upcoming EPA decisions on emissions limits could be a sign of what to expect. By Neela Banerjee, Washington Bureau December 8, 2012, 6:08 p.m. WASHINGTON — On election night, President Obama uttered a phrase that thrilled environmentalists. "We want our children to live in an America that isn't burdened by debt, that isn't weakened by inequality," Obama said, "that isn't threatened by the destructive power of a warming planet." Environmental optimists run the risk, however, of ending up like a kid who expected a puppy for Christmas and got socks instead. Those in industry who think that Obama's frequent campaign talk about the benefits of oil and gas could mean opening more land to drilling may also be disappointed. Over the last four years, Obama charted a middle course on the environment that led to landmark pollution rules, growth in clean energy and the continued development of fossil fuels. For at least much of his second term, there will probably be no sweeping new legislation on climate, air or water pollution, many analysts say, especially with the House of Representatives still controlled by Republicans who view environmental safeguards as economic threats. At the same time, it is unlikely that the administration will throw open vast new swaths of federal lands to oil and gas development. "This was not a status quo election, but that doesn't mean the president is going to move on a liberal agenda," said Joshua Freed, vice president of the clean energy program at Third Way, a center-left Washington think tank. "Instead, what the president has done over the first term is a good road map of what to look for in his second." The White House and entities such as the Environmental Protection Agency and Interior and Energy departments will more likely carry on the painstaking work of building out programs and regulations they began in the first term. Some analysts say an incremental approach might stand a better chance than a grand legislative effort to reshape the country's energy sources, cars and air and water quality. "There are lots of smaller things you could do, and because they're not set up as an emblematic fight, you might miss the fact that things are getting done and getting done faster," said David Goldston, director of governmental affairs for the Natural Resources Defense Council. The administration has yet to reveal specifics regarding a second-term energy and environment agenda and declined to discuss it, focusing for the moment on a deal with Congress to avert the "fiscal cliff." At a Nov. 14 news conference, Obama said of climate change: "We have not done as much as we need to. You can expect that you will hear more from me in the coming months and years about how we can shape an agenda that garners bipartisan support and helps move this agenda forward." But the president went on to say that one approach many environmentalists hope to see, a tax on emissions of carbon dioxide, was off the table so far. The question is how many months and years elapse before that climate agenda emerges. Fiscal and immigration reforms are among Obama's top priorities. Environmentalists said they would like for him to talk about climate change as often as he does about tax reform. "We want to see him use the bully pulpit of the presidency to elevate the issue," said Gene Karpinski, president of the League of Conservation Voters. For its part, the House Energy and Commerce Committee vowed to challenge any new rules curtailing pollutants including carbon dioxide, the main driver of climate change. "Republicans will continue to support a true 'all-of-the-above' energy strategy that lets all sources of American energy compete," said the chairman of the Energy and Power Subcommittee, Rep. Edward Whitfield (R-Ky.). "This means stopping regulatory policies that unfairly punish affordable energy sources." Industry and environmentalists say decisions the administration will issue over the next few months could be indicators of what to expect over the next four years. Reductions in greenhouse gas emissions could be set into motion in early 2013, when the EPA is expected to finalize limits on carbon dioxide emissions from new power plants, a step analysts contend will accelerate the existing trend of phasing out coal-fired boilers. The next step would be to address carbon from existing plants, a much tougher fight. By Wednesday, the EPA is set to issue its final rules on soot, the fine particles emitted by power plants and diesel vehicles that contribute to haze and respiratory ailments. The stringency of the final standard could signal the level of the agency's regulatory aggressiveness. As soon as Dec. 17, the EPA is also expected to issue a report examining the impact on water sources of hydraulic fracturing, or fracking, a controversial oil and gas production method. The industry, which asserts that water has never been contaminated by fracking, will be watching for hints of possible federal regulations in the EPA findings. "Look at what natural gas is doing for greenhouse gas emissions," said Jack Gerard, chief executive of the American Petroleum Institute, the chief oil and gas lobbyist. Gerard pointed out that the fall in carbon emissions in the U.S. has been largely driven by more power plants burning gas rather than coal. "You can't be for natural gas and against hydraulic fracturing." Gerard also considers the administration's long-awaited decision on the Keystone XL pipeline from Canada a possible bellwether on energy policy. The oil industry has pushed hard for approval of the pipeline, which would being bring oil from the tar sands of Alberta to refineries on the Gulf Coast, saying it would create jobs and reduce dependence on oil from overseas. The administration is expected to make its decision in the first quarter of 2013. Environmentalists rail against the pipeline, contending it would destroy vast parts of Canada, boost carbon emissions and threaten the Midwest's primary aquifer. "It's the first clearest test of how committed the president is to turning away from dirty fuels," said Michael Brune, executive director of the Sierra Club. "You can't say you're committed to fighting climate change and turn around to approve a pipeline that would pump the dirtiest oil in the world." latimesDOTcom/news/nationworld/nation/la-na-obama-environment-20121209,0,3747120.story</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1355026235635</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-12-08 23:10:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1355026287264-16</Id><Title>On environment, Obama likely to keep walking middle line</Title><Msg>On environment, Obama likely to keep walking middle line His second term is unlikely to feature sweeping legislation on pollution or climate change.
