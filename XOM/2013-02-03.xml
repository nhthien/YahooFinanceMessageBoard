The John Muir Trust (JMT), one of Scotland's leading conservation bodies, has challenged the common assertion that wind farms run at an average of 30 per cent capacity over a year. A study carried out for the Trust into the energy generated by dozens of wind farms, the majority of which are in Scotland, between November 2009 and last month, found they actually ran at 22 per cent of capacity. Campaigners insist the figures, drawn from data provided by the National Grid, challenge the role of wind farms as an efficient source of renewable energy. They said hundreds of wind farms had secured planning permission across Scotland based on inaccurate assumptions of their output. "This analysis shows that over the course of a year, the average load factor fell well short of what the industry claims, yet the 30 per cent figure is peddled at every public inquiry into a proposed wind farm," said Helen McDade, head of policy at the JMT. "This data is needed to counter that hype."</Msg><Username>dai_gul_dai</Username><Timestamp>1359880022216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 03:27:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359885050895-5</Id><Topic><Title>Blew Cheese.........why are you posting inefficient Windmill #$%$..You own no XOM</Title><Username>dai_gul_dai</Username><Timestamp>1359785920157</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 01:18:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>E20 will kill cars, as does E15.

(FSLR), the world’s largest maker of thin-film solar panels, may sell electricity at a lower rate than new coal plants earn, according to a regulatory filing from a project it purchased in New Mexico. El Paso Electric Co. (EE) agreed to buy power from First Solar’s the 50-megawatt Macho Springs project for 5.79 cents a kilowatt- hour, according to a Jan. 22 procedural order from the New Mexico Public Regulation Commission. That’s less than half the 12.8 cents a kilowatt-hour for power from typical new coal plants, according to models compiled by Bloomberg. First Solar, which said in a statement yesterday that it bought the Macho Springs project from Element Power Solar, didn’t disclose any of the state and federal incentives that will boost the company’s revenue from the project. The Macho Springs rate would be “the lowest solar power purchase agreement price we have ever seen,” Aaron Chew, an analyst at Maxim Group LLC in New York, said in an e-mail. It’s less than half the rate that First Solar will get for its Antelope Valley, Topaz, and Agua Caliente projects, he said. Federal and state incentives will probably supplement First Solar’s revenue from the project. That support includes a 30 percent federal business energy investment tax credit, according to Anthony Kim, an analyst for Bloomberg New Energy Finance said today in an interview. Incentives vary widely by location and aren’t included in the London-based research company’s levelized pricing models. “When you add in the incentives, the PPA value becomes more comparable to rates we’ve seen signed in California,” said Kim. El Paso Electric must submit additional information by today on how renewable-energy credits related to the project may affect the utility’s costs. Alan Bernheimer, a spokesman for Tempe, Arizona-based First Solar, wouldn’t confirm the rate in the regulatory filing. “That information is usually confidential,” he said. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-01/first-solar-may-sell-cheapest-solar-power-less-than-coal.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359912234466</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 12:23:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359913764829-20</Id><Topic><Title>Downgraded - just the beginning</Title><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1359592028189</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 19:27:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Got schooling?</Msg><Username>nip7890</Username><Timestamp>1359913764829</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 12:49:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359914115262-21</Id><Topic><Title>First Solar May Sell Cheapest Solar Power, Less Than Coal</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359912234466</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 12:23:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Saudi Arabia Completes Massive Solar Farm Saudi Arabia hits a major milestone in solar power generation, one step closer to achieving aggressive goals in renewable energy 2 FEB 2013 Carin Hall Saudi Arabia, the world leader in oil production, has completed its largest ground-mounted solar farm in capital Riyadh. The 3.5 MW plant, built by Germany-based Pheonix Solar AG, uses 12,684 solar panels from China's Suntech Power Holdings Co. Ltd., with inverters supplied from SMA Solar Technology AG. "We are pleased to complete this historic project which will provide clean, renewable energy for KAPSARC as well as for the Saudi grid,” Phoenix Solar's Middle East Chief Klaus Friedl was quoted as saying in the report. The project is a major milestone in the Kingdom, as it strives to generate a third of its electricity with solar power by 2032. The country plans to boost the use of renewable energy as a means to cut back on domestic use of oil, which could easily translate to billions of dollars in annual savings. More money will be made from exporting the oil, while less money will be spent on domestic production of electricity. Related story: Saudi Arabia to Become a 100% Renewable Energy Nation Within two decades, Saudi Arabia aims to have 41,000 megawatts of solar capacity, according to earlier statements made from Maher al-Odan, a consultant at the King Abdullah City for Atomic and Renewable Energy. "We'll build part of our product in your region, so we'll create jobs. And we'll offer you electricity less costly than you pay now, and you can sell that oil to America or whomever,” CEO Tom Werner told the San Francisco Gate. “There's a jobs element and a technology element and a timing element, and it's happening now because the cost of solar has come down so much." energydigitalDOTcom/renewable_energy/saudi-arabia-completes-massive-solar-farm</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359914115262</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 12:55:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359914621902-22</Id><Topic><Title>What Has Any Republican EVER Done To Help Middle Class?</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1359895848355</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 07:50:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>With help from Bernie Sanders in the Senate no less.</Msg><Username>kcannuli</Username><Timestamp>1359914621902</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 13:03:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359914925718-23</Id><Title>50 Americans raped a day under Obama in the US Armed Forces</Title><Msg>Democrats are equally proud of the two suicides per day of US Veterans.

V3Solar has a brand-new solar panel design that they say will cost just 8 cents a kilowatt-hour, compared to 12 cents on average for the U.S. What they don’t have yet is a working prototype. 1 Comments We’re all used to the pictures of roofs or fields covered with solar panels. But what if a new form factor could fundamentally change how solar works? A company called V3Solar has announced a brand new solar panel design--called the CoolSpin--that it says will make power 34% cheaper than the cheapest existing solar panels, putting the output well below the cost of generating even coal (8 cents versus 12 cents a kilowatt-hour, respectively). An independent technical reviewer agrees with the efficiency of their design. Could this be the breakthrough that the solar industry has been waiting for? A big maybe. It’s certainly a cool looking design. The installations look like blue mushrooms. On top is a layer of lenses, which concentrate the energy coming in up to 20 times. They’re Fresnel lenses, an extra-thin, multipart lens invented in the 1790s for use on lighthouses, which concentrate a small lantern into a powerful beam. Also like lighthouses, the cones rotate. This way they can take the sun coming in from all directions. The spinning and the lenses remove two problems found in most low-cost flat-panel solar installations: They usually face in only one direction on a roof and can only get optimal energy from the sun a few hours a day at best, or else they need high-cost mechanical and electronic tracking mechanisms. The spinning also cools the panels by throwing them quickly from light into shade--most solar concentrating designs must use water or mechanical cooling, which gets expensive. The shape, spinning, and lenses layered on top, taken together, may boost the cells’ performance many times over. Finally, the whole thing is self-contained and can be mounted on a metal pole like a parking meter, rather than needing special racks, which lowers the cost as well and potentially makes it a good fit for small distributed energy installations, like in cities. EDITOR’S NOTE The Windstrument is a similar project: It reinvents the classic wind turbine into something more efficient and compact for cities. While still lacking a working prototype, the company claims to have 4 gigawatts of pre-orders. The current total installed solar in the U.S. is only 7 gigawatts, so embrace that stat (and the ones about how efficient the panels are) with a healthy dose of skepticism. If there’s anything we’ve learned, it’s that advances in clean energy come in tiny increments. A new solar panel design that’s both more efficient and cheaper can’t be considered anything but a pipe dream until it’s tested in the field. But even if V3Solar’s design doesn’t live up to its promise, all new ideas are welcome until we get to 100% renewable energy. The horizon is crowded with interesting new ideas for better ways to capture energy of the sun: space solar, ultraportable solar, microsolar, and solar biomimicry to name a few. We’ll have to check in a year or so to see if CoolSpin is cool, or just spin. fastcoexistDOTcom/mba/1681287/are-these-spinning-blue-cones-the-solar-panels-of-the-future</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359915069853</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 13:11:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359915202377-25</Id><Topic><Title>In Depth XOM Research Report !</Title><Username>beverlybrown584</Username><Timestamp>1359908983786</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 11:29:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Useful report !</Msg><Username>woodham.sandra</Username><Timestamp>1359915202377</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 13:13:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359918755399-26</Id><Topic><Title>I Guess He never Saw It Coming....</Title><Username>walhieeeeeee</Username><Timestamp>1359896871213</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 08:07:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your typical sick, brain dead response, proving again there's no cure for brain death.

In fact, global warming is only one of the “Six drivers of global change.” Others drivers include globalization, the internet (surprise, surprise) and “the reinvention of life and death” from the genomic, biotech, neuroscience, and life sciences revolutions. Any Gore book is worth reading — Our Choice is one of the best books on climate solutions — and The Future is no exception. Let me cut to the chase on climate and energy. In his discussion of why the climate bill failed after passing the US House, Gore takes a different view of one recent academic essay and slams the White House. … the obsolete and dysfunctional rules of the U.S. Senate empowered a minority to kill it in that chamber. Senators in both parties said privately that passage of the climate plan might have been within reach but it seemed to them that President Obama was not prepared to make the all-out effort that would have been necessary to build a coalition in support of the plan. Earlier, he had chosen to make healthcare reform his number one priority, and the badly broken U.S. political system produced a legislative gridlock on his health plan that lasted until the midterm campaign season began, leaving no time for even Senate discussion of the climate change issue. By then, Obama and his political team in the White House had apparently long since made a sober assessment of the political risks involved in states where the power of the fossil fuel industries would punish him for committing himself to the passage of this plan. So, instead, when his opponents in Congress took up the cry “drill, baby, drill,” the president proposed expansion of oil drilling–even in the Arctic Ocean–and opened up more public land to coal mining. For these and other reasons, the positive impacts of the energy and climate proposals with which he began his presidency were nearly overwhelmed by his sharp turn toward a policy that he described as an “all of the above” approach – one that has contributed to the increased reliance on carbon-rich fossil fuels. Precisely. Gore has a long discussion on one new source of fossil fuels in particular, natural gas from fracking. The whole discussion is thoughtful and well worth reading. Here is what the Nobel-Prize winning former VP concludes: Years ago I was among those who recommended the greater use of conventional natural gas as a bridge fuel to phase out coal use more quickly while solar and wind technologies were produced at sufficient scale to bring their price down even more. However, it is increasingly clear that the net effect of shale gas on the environment may ultimately be inconsistent with its use as a bridge fuel. Global society as a whole would find it difficult to make the enormous investments necessary to switch from coal to gas, and then turn right around and make equally significant investments to substitute were nubile technologies for gas. It strains credulity. In other words, it may be a bridge to nowhere. Again, precisely. So many recent futurist books ignore or downplay the polar bear in the room, which isn’t a mistake Gore makes. I highly recommend The Future as one of the most comprehensive and readable books on the subject written in recent years. reneweconomyDOTcomDOTau/2013/al-gore-obama-could-have-a-climate-bill-gas-a-bridge-to-nowhere-93022</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359940735844</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 20:18:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359943378541-32</Id><Topic><Title>WAHLEE WAS DEPORTED!</Title><Username>wahleee_suks_coc</Username><Timestamp>1359766723167</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 19:58:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>God Bless America!

At either state of federal level? Before we try and answer that, what does the energy chief of the world’s largest economy and energy user have to say about the challenges and possibilities in front of us? The biggest takeout is the cost of big solar. One of Chu’s big initiatives was the SunShot program – launched just over two years ago with the aim of taking the cost of utility scale PV down to $1/W by 2020, at which price it would deliver energy at a levelised cost of energy (LCOE) of around $60/MWh, cheaper than coal, and cheaper than gas, even with the shale and fracking boom. “When we first discussed this goal, industry did not take it seriously,” Chu writes in his letter. “Today, they tell me that our input challenged them to rethink their road maps and now agree that it is an achievable goal.” It is not as wild as it may seem. Bloomberg reports that First Solar has signed a power purchase agreement to deliver energy from a 50MW solar PV plant in New Mexico to the local utility for $69/MWh. That’s nearly half the cost of new coal plants. It’s likely assisted by investment tax credits, but the clear sign is that it is getting close. The second big change Chu predicted was in the deployment of electric vehicles. Even if some sales expectation have fallen short, there are nearly 500,000 EVs and hybrid cars in the US, and Chu says the batteries developed for these vehicles will also revolutionize the electrical distribution system and the use of renewable energy. And, as we have been banging on for a while (and been mocked by many within the industry for doing so), Chu notes that the combination of cheap solar, battery technology, and the arrival of wind energy at grid parity in less than a decade means that new business models for the energy market need to be developed. If it is not, he suggests, it will stand as a major barrier to their deployment. “Unless we develop new business models with utility companies and other stake holders, we will not be able to take full advantage of the accelerating pace of technology.” This fits in with my theory that technology advances will do most of the job required, so long as the politicians stand out of the way and don’t seek to protect the incumbents with regulatory and yet more subsidies. Chu notes that the massive engagement by the private sector in the last two years – including from the likes of Warren Buffett, Bank of America, Wells Fargo and Google, – means that renewable energy investment has become mainstream. “Originally, skeptical lenders and investors now see that renewable energy will profitable,” he writes. “These investors are voting where it counts the most – with their wallet. As one CEO recently commented, ‘Solar is now bankable. When solar was perceived as more risky it required a premium’.” He also defended the loan program instituted by the DoE, and lamented the attention given to the likes of Solyndra. “While critics try hard to discredit the program, the truth is that only one percent of the companies of the companies we funded went bankrupt. That one percent has gotten more attention than the 99 percent that have not. “The test for America’s policy makers will be whether they are willing to accept a few failures in exchange for many successes. America’s entrepreneurs and innovators who are leaders in global clean energy race understand that not every risk can – or should – be avoided. Michelangelo said, ‘The greater danger for most of us lies not in setting our aim too high and falling short; but in setting our aim too low, and achieving our mark’.” Those last paragraphs seem particularly relevant for Australia, heading as we appear to be towards a conservative election victory, the threatened repeal of the carbon price and the promised demolition of the Clean Energy Finance Corp, which is similar in intent to Chu program at DoE, but is dismissed in the mindless reactionary energy politics produced by Ian Macfarlane, Andrew Robb Joe Hockey as a sinkhole for new, uneconomic technologies. Perhaps they should look at the recent history of solar PV. Chu’s statement comes as the US announces that its emissions have fallen to their lowest level since 1994, proving that you do not necessarily need a carbon price to achieve emission reductions. But if you do choose Direct Action, then those policies need to have bite. The US has done it by imposing strict energy efficiency standards, and strict pollution and emission controls, which has forced nearly 100 coal-fired plants to close. The Australian conservatives propose Mickey Mouse programs and government handouts to help those coal-fired utilities to achieve what should be a legal requirement. That money is better spent on developing new technologies, as is done in the US. The entire letter of Chu’s is worth a read. But here are some of the other main takeouts. - The United States spent roughly $430 billion on foreign oil in 2012 – a direct wealth transfer out of our country. Billions more are spent to keep oil shipping lanes open and oil geo-politics add considerable additional burdens. Although our oil imports are projected to fall to a 25 year low next year, the US still pays a heavy economic, national security and human cost for its oil addiction. - The average temperature of our planet is rising, with majority of the temperature increase occurring in the last thirty years. During the three decades from 1980 to 2011, the number of violent storms, floods, droughts, heat waves, wildfires, as tabulated by the reinsurance company Munich Re, has increased more than three-fold. They also estimate that the financial losses follow a trend line that has gone from $40 billion to $170 billion dollars per year. As the President said in his recent Inaugural Address, “some may still deny the overwhelming judgment of science, but none can avoid the devastating impact of raging fires, and crippling drought, and more powerful storms.” - The overwhelming scientific consensus is that human activity has had a significant and likely dominant role in climate change. There is also increasingly compelling evidence that the weather changes we have witnessed during this thirty year time period are due to climate change. - Virtually all of the other OECD countries, and most developing countries including China, India, Mexico, and Brazil have accepted the judgment of climate scientists. - Many countries, but most notably China, realize that the development of clean energy technologies presents an incredible economic opportunity in an emerging world market. China now exceeds the US in internal deployment of clean energy and in government investments to further develop the technologies. - While we cannot accurately predict the course of climate change in the coming decades, the risks we run if we don’t change our course are enormous. Prudent risk management does not equate uncertainty with inaction. - We have a moral responsibility “to the most innocent victims of adverse climate change.” Those who will suffer the most are the people who are the most innocent: the world’s poorest citizens and those yet to be born. There is an ancient Native American saying: “We do not inherit the land from our ancestors, we borrow it from our children.” A few short decades later, we don’t want our children to ask, “What were our parents thinking? Didn’t they care about us?” reneweconomyDOTcomDOTau/2013/chu-resigns-promises-big-solar-soon-to-be-cheaper-than-coal-74823</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359943981197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 21:13:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359949731637-34</Id><Topic><Title>Chu says big solar soon to be cheaper than coal and gas</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359943981197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 21:13:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it would great if this occurred.

Measures taken by Brazil’s government to increase fuel prices and raise the amount of ethanol blended into gasoline will help boost biofuel demand, said Ivan Melo, a commercial director at the joint venture known as Raizen. Sugar fell 16 percent last year and 27 percent in 2011, the biggest two-year drop since 1999. Raizen produces sugar and ethanol. “With gasoline prices rising 6.6 percent, hydrous ethanol is now more competitive,” Melo said in an interview at the Kingsman sugar conference in Dubai yesterday, referring to the 100 percent ethanol fuel used in flex fuel cars. “If the harvest starts with sugar prices at current levels, we will begin the season with more incentive to make ethanol.” Petroleo Brasileiro SA (PETR4), Brazil’s state-controlled oil company, increased gasoline prices at refineries by 6.6 percent last week. The government also said it will raise the amount of anhydrous ethanol blended into gasoline to 25 percent in May from 20 percent now. Brazil’s control over gasoline prices in a bid to limit inflation had made ethanol uncompetitive. Millers in Brazil directed 49.59 percent of all their sugar cane in the 2012-13 season to make sugar, as prices for the sweetener were still more favorable, data from industry group Unica showed. That was up from 48.44 percent a year earlier. The allocation of raw material to ethanol is likely to change this year, as the increase in the blend will generate additional ethanol demand of 1.2 billion liters (3.2 billion gallons), Melo estimates. Record Crop Brazil will harvest a record 585 million metric tons of sugar cane in the 2013-14 season that starts in April there, according to Raizen. That’s up from 531.9 million tons in 2012-13, Unica data show. Sugar output is currently estimated at 36.3 million tons, Melo said. That could still change depending on how the government’s measures affect ethanol consumption, he said. Millers in the South American nation have been holding back sales of this year’s crop in the futures market due to uncertainty over what will happen to ethanol demand, Melo said. Sales are currently estimated at 30 percent to 40 percent of output, he said. At this time of year, millers would usually have sold about 50 percent, according to Armajaro Trading Group Ltd., a London-based supplier of sugar, cocoa and coffee. Harvest Scenarios With the outlook for sugar’s crop “good,” Brazil probably hasn’t sold enough sugar in the futures market, Melo said. If the harvest is disrupted, and sugar supplies are lower than last year, then Brazil was “just about right” to hold back on sales, he said. Sugar, the third worse performing commodity in the Standard &amp; Poors GSCI gauge of 24 raw materials last year, will trade at 17 cents and 20 cents a pound during this year’s harvest in Brazil, which runs from April to December, Melo said. Sugar is down 3.2 percent this year, with speculators boosting bets on lower prices by 28 percent, data from the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission showed. Net-short positions were 75,108 lots as of Jan. 29, up from 58,621 contracts at the end of last year. “Who said the current measures are the only ones the government will take?” Melo said. “If the government takes more steps that give the incentive for hydrous ethanol consumption, the shorts will need to start getting worried, though any measure taken by the government will not be enough to erase the world’s sugar surplus.” Sugar supplies will be about 8 million tons higher than demand in the 12 months starting in April, Raizen estimates. Raw sugar for March delivery rose 0.6 percent to 18.89 cents a pound on Feb. 1 on ICE Futures U.S. in New York. bloombergDOTcom/news/2013-02-03/raizen-sees-brazilian-millers-favoring-ethanol-at-harvest-start.html</Msg><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359950812833</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 23:06:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359952477813-36</Id><Topic><Title>Chu says big solar soon to be cheaper than coal and gas</Title><Username>bluecheese4u</Username><Timestamp>1359943981197</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 21:13:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Texas leads nation in wind power--if you get the politics out of it then N Mex and AZ could easily lead nation in solar (big projs not rooftops) if Obama will keep up push for nuclear plants and the infrastructure gets in place (once again politics of GOP) then there will soon be gas terminals along ALL the interstates gonna set up for a cheap energy (or for sure much cheaper) ENERGY revolution in USA we will need it to compete with countries like Scotland which will very soon be able to offer free power to any plant or manuf willing to relocate and while the use of oil for diesel goes to 0--zip--nada as 18 wheelers use nat gas--the price of oil will decline substantial all good for ALL the USA well except for GOP politicians that laugh at hope and change but offer NOTHING but cokblock and filibuster but the American voters are becoming more aware of the GOP way every day--and not liking what they see USA USA USA there is no destroying the oil cos--taxing energy out of business--blah blah only record drilling--permits--production BABY</Msg><Username>mrsuerte</Username><Timestamp>1359952477813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 23:34:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
