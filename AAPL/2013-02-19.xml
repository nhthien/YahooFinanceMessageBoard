I made my success in the 90s using Microsoft technologies, but in the latter part of the last decade I (and my family and businesses) switched to Apple technologies. I love that writing code on a Mac Book is the same as writing code on a UNIX mainframe and that I can develop scalable applications using all the great technologies (Apache, PHP, MySQL, Oracle, etc) and I never am forced to redesign to scale my applications after they get off the beta phase (unlike with MS where you're constantly searching for ways to scale and work around the limitations). I also love that I can run any application whether it be web-based or Xcode on i(whatever, phone, Pad, Touch) and that I never have to concern myself with backups (Time Capsule was a savior for all of us who suffered for years trying to get good backups of Windows). I have to concede also that as a decade + victim of the "Blue Screen of Death" there are few things as delightful as the stable nature of OSX. I could go on about Apple but you get the idea. Now here's my beef. I understand that Apple is a big company and big companies are difficult to run. I also know that great innovations don't happen every 6 months and that's fine as well. But what I dislike right now about Apple is that you aren't doing the daily "blocking and tackling" required to keep your user's confidence. For example, releasing the iPhone 5 with Apple's hack of a Google Map was irritating. If there's one thing Apple customer expect it's consistency and sensibility. The iPhone 5 release was neither. Here's another example - last night I went to iTunes to make a purchase and your severs were down ! You couldn't process my credit card. This wasn't a momentary problem. I called your tech support and spent over an hour with your servers rejecting the purchase. Your tech support rep said "sometimes that just happens to me as well". After a while I went over the Amazon and made the purchase. Tim, you have to know that if you can't process revenues handed to you by CCs then you are going to destroy this company and the stock to go with it. That's just unacceptable. You were handed a Cadillac and you're operating it like a Microsoft Windows release. Here's another incident - when I upgraded to Mountain Lion I assumed that like my previous OSX upgrades it would be done in a few moments and well worth the time and money. After 4 weeks of troubleshooting I gave up and changed my entire development architecture so that I wouldn't be affected by future OSX updates. You guys did things like remove the FTP service and it's control applet apparently to force us over to ML server. That's a fraud. It's wreaks of MS tactics such as removing helpful features like Remote Desktop and then adding them back to create different versions of its OS like Windows Pro, WIndows Home, Windows at Work, Windows for Canines, etc. This sort of thing speaks to an uninspired mindset. These are the types of management decisions that got Carley thrown out of HP. Her campaigns were full of "Invent" and the "Network as Service" and so on, and then she went and bought a PC maker. Apple is the best product maker in this sector by far, whether you bring any new ideas, or not, and the growth potential is enormous - unless you continue to be short-sighted, continue unproductive tactics like removing proven features and fail to keep your credit card processing servers online. That's the bottom line. All you need to do everyday is keep Apple running and it will continue to reward you. If you can't do that, please hire someone who will. Noone wants to see this wonderful company's status as an innovator devolve because it started to behave like HP or Microsoft. - Richard Nichols, M.D., MS BME.</Msg><Username>rxnichols</Username><Timestamp>1361256147772</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 01:42:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361256685615-11</Id><Title>Tomorrow apple goes into the 440's r/t Goog retail store news</Title><Msg>Based off of Goog retail news, aapl will most likely dip into the 440's.

In China's Congress, there are now 100 Billionaires (NY Times and WSJ article reported). China now has more than enough well off people to buy IPHONEs and they pay more in China for them than USA.

Short term i think the market will get hit hard by sequestration and suddenly people will be looking for safe havens again and will flood back to apple. Thats just my opinion but technically if you look at a 6 month chart theres a very strong case to say the bottom is in. This is the stock market though, and reason is no where to be seen when a market it up 6% already. Dow has to hit 21,000 to hold this bullish sentiment all year.

The top big customers, the richer customers who can afford to pay higher prices for slightly better product, or for fancier perfume bottle...etc. This explains why Apple made 72% of all the profits worldwide in smartphones (and more in IPADS) last year, even though worldwide Apple only had bit over 20% of the market (in USA Apple had 50% of the market). Apple has t he top 20% of the market socio-economically where 80% of the worldwide profits are. Samsung has more market share, but only had 30% of the profits in smartphones (Samsung had to spend over 2X as much on Ads as Apple to even get less than half the profits). Having the top 20% of a market where 80% of the profits are is a nice place to be. NOKIA, SONY, MOT, BBRY, HTC...etc. altogher made $0 in smartphones in 2012 same report showed.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1361283133993</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:12:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361283138007-178</Id><Title>Samdungfungsung app I-COPY!</Title><Msg>Buy.</Msg><Username>kdkellyllc</Username><Timestamp>1361283138007</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:12:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361283186470-179</Id><Topic><Title>fuzz taking care Apple old business</Title><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361282867729</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:07:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>it all so easy to see... nothing new to you</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1361283186470</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 09:13:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361283234170-180</Id><Topic><Title>Technical Analysis of Appl</Title><Username>carson5016</Username><Timestamp>1361207421150</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 12:10:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>TA means squat on a manipulated stock.

The stock was trading around $600 since they announced the dividend. Now at $460. I guess that pity $2 didn't help much. Then is the buyback. Aapl purchased this year alone $8 bil in shares and the stock is still down 15%. Can you imagine how low aapl would be without a dividend and buybacks?

Samsung sells mainly low-cost 'feature phones' in India where it has 51% of the market, but given low price doesn't make so much money. Apple selling to the top end of the market only makes 72% of worldwide profits in all smartphone sales. Even moreso with IPADs. Cook said 80 - 90% of internet traffic from Tablets is from IPADs...; so he doesn't know what the buyers of cheap other tablets are doing with them?

I don't care about opinions just facts.</Msg><Username>longtermbuys5</Username><Timestamp>1361286661862</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:11:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361286666714-373</Id><Topic><Title>Totally ridiculous</Title><Username>porkypiggins</Username><Timestamp>1361286262006</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:04:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>actually, i have so much cash in the sidelines, I hope aapl keeps being taken down, down, down I would love to buy at $400</Msg><Username>seriouslynot</Username><Timestamp>1361286666714</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:11:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361286668695-374</Id><Topic><Title>anyone else wanna sell? here's your last chance</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1361286405034</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:06:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I admire your optimism, but I don't believe you are correct.

In my opinion, these analysts are losing credibility every time they write about some product prediction. Who knows if Apple is going to have a cheaper iPhone? Who knows if the iWatch is real? Who knows if the dividend is going up? NO ONE except the top guys at Apple. In the meantime, we have to sit and watch Apple's share price go through a painfully slow decay. It's maddening, really, but until Tim Cook or the Board does something REAL, this stock is going to go down. My advice. If you believe in Apple management, then turn off the message board and your iPhone tickers, and wait for some actual catalyst. Then - and only then - will the stock get back to where it should be. IMO, that place is a PE in the 13-15 range.</Msg><Username>financefrau</Username><Timestamp>1361286900378</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:15:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361286901854-395</Id><Title>APPLE IS BROKEN!!!!

Still long and still frustrated.</Msg><Username>monkey449</Username><Timestamp>1361287122287</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:18:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361287158388-417</Id><Topic><Title>ROTATION WAS GOING ON</Title><Username>aea_student</Username><Timestamp>1359900336798</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-02-03 09:05:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and still is ....</Msg><Username>aea_student</Username><Timestamp>1361287158388</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:19:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361287164349-418</Id><Topic><Title>my prediction: AAPL closes higher today</Title><Username>geosmart668</Username><Timestamp>1361286500179</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:08:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I have a bad feeling the board will disappoint as well.

However that growth is slowing and projected to slow even more markedly in the future. More worrisome is the even faster deceleration of net income growth. The reasons are twofold. First are the markets themselves. While neither the smart phone nor the table markets are saturated, neither market is still in hyper growth mode either. Secondly, competition. The effect of better competition can clearly be seen in this chart showing Apple's net margin over the last 5 years. There has been an alarming decrease in the margins starting early last year, which is indicative of increased competitive and pricing pressures. The better competition forces Apple to bring products out at more aggressive price points. The iPad mini, Mac re-pricing and continued iPhone 4 sales from the carriers despite the release of the 4S and 5 are all evidence of this.</Msg><Username>bakert82</Username><Timestamp>1361287612992</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:26:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361287618718-447</Id><Topic><Title>THE DUDE ON CNBC SAID ANDROID IS KILLING IOS</Title><Username>bagholder_19</Username><Timestamp>1361287456424</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:24:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I purchased Android device, to see what the fuss is all about and coz I build apps, so I need test device.

Been using the same store for over 3 yrs now. Milk was 3.59 is now 4.99. Bread was 1.29 is now 1.79. Gas was 3.69 is now 4.09. This is only over 2 weeks. The US consumer is screwed. There is the proof. These are the highest prices I have ever seen for Shaw's branded items. I asked the manager if the prices are correct and he checked them. They are right-not a database issue. I then went to a competing store 5 miles away-gallon of milk was 4.79. I asked the manager why and how much as milk gone up over 2 weeks. He said over a 1.00 because of the weak dollar and rising gas prices. US is screwed-deep recession coming if we are only in a recession.</Msg><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1361288909457</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:48:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361288916178-564</Id><Topic><Title>HEY SKIPPYS!!

Hardly a week goes by without seeing yet another title with a variant of "too little too late" or "dead company walking" etc., etc. Let's face it, it's all getting a little cliché. The press has been calling for the company's demise for almost two years, but it is still alive and kicking. Many analysts and writers have got it so wrong and have ignored basic mathematical facts for so long that it would be comical if the stakes weren't so high. We can expect these baseless conjectures to continue and the headline battle to heat up as we approach the moment of truth sometime in March - when the company releases hard numbers. But the fact of the matter is, we don't operate in a pure speculative vacuum anymore. There is already enough empirical evidence out there now for us to start making some reasonable guesstimates: The next generation BlackBerry Z10 devices are out in many markets, early sales indicators are in, we know what the ASP is in various markets and carriers, and we know approximately how much it costs to make a Z10, so we can start taking a stab at the gross margin. It's about time for some intellectual honesty. Get off your lazy butts, sharpen some pencils and do some real financial analysis. I challenge both sides to crunch some numbers and start making rational, numerical arguments with reasonable assumptions rather than trying to grab page views with polarizing headlines. My approach is very simple. To be safe, I have erred as much as possible to the side of pessimism in my analysis. But even with this conservative approach, the results are staggering - the elephant in the room is that BlackBerry does not need to sell anywhere near as many units as iPhone or Android to be immensely successful financially. Even with conservative assumptions, the results are so unbelievable that I encourage my readers to rip this analysis apart and call me out on any mistakes. I'll share the results with you first and then work back to justify the key assumptions: Actual Possible Scenarios Q3 Annualized Best Case: IDC 2015 Prediction (14% Market Share) Median Case: 10% Market Share Worst Case: No Improvement over BB7 (4.5% Market Share) Key Assumptions BB10 Units Shipped 0.0 101.1 72.2 32.5 Assuming no growth in global smartphone market (2012: 722.4M units sold) HW Gross Margin ($) 0.0 15170.4 10836.0 4875.0 Z10 has lower cost than Lumia 920 and around the same ASP, but to be conservative, we'll use the same margin contribution at 150/unit. Also assuming $0 margin for BB7 units so those sales are ignored BB7 Subscribers Remaining 79.0 28.4 42.9 62.8 50% of new BB10 sales cannibalize existing BB7 subscribers S&amp;S Revenue 4363.2 1570.3 2368.3 3465.7 Software &amp; Services fall assuming $0 S&amp;S from BB10 S&amp;S Gross Margin ($) 3320.0 1194.9 1802.0 2637.1 Operating Expenses 4240.0 5240.0 5240.0 5240.0 Conservatively ignore all additional savings from their "CORE" program, and add 1B for launch-related costs Operating Income -920.0 11125.3 7398.0 2272.1 Taxes -904.0 2558.8 1701.6 522.6 Tax rate of 23% as of the last profitable year (FY 2011) Income After Tax -16.0 8566.5 5696.5 1749.5 EPS 0.0 16.3 10.9 3.3 Target Price 163.5 108.7 33.4 10x P/E Unit Sales First, the most unpredictable variable is unit sales. For this reason, I have created 3 scenarios which should cover the range of probable outcomes. IDC recently predicted that BlackBerry will have 14% market share in 2 years, which, if it comes true, will value BBRY shares at $163.5. For the sake of caution, I am using this IDC estimate as the best case scenario in the analysis. The median case scenario I used was 10% market share. Even if BlackBerry 10 does not outsell the iPhone or Samsung (SSNLF.PK) devices, it is certainly imaginable that 1 in 10 new smartphone sold will be a BB10 device, and anecdotal evidence so far supports this scenario, which sits between IDC's estimate and BlackBerry's 2012 market share. For the worst case scenario, I've assumed that BB10 does absolutely nothing to improve the situation over BB7. This is a ludicrous claim given that early indicators tell us the Z10 blew past all records previously held by older BlackBerry devices. But I've included it anyway for argument's sake. In all 3 cases, I assumed there will be no more growth in the global smartphone market, thus I have re-used IDC's 2012 estimate of 722.4M smartphones sold as the denominator to come up with a units shipped number for BlackBerry's market share. This is yet another conservative assumption, given that actual Q4 2012 shipments grew by 70.2%. Gross Margin According to an independent report on Nokia (NOK) Lumia, the Lumia 920 has ASP of 338 euros, bill of material (BOM) of 163 euros, and gross margin of 34.9% after adding in non-material costs. This gives margin contribution of 118 euros or approximately $150 per unit. We now also know that the BlackBerry Z10's BOM is around $154, significantly less than the Lumia 920; and the unlocked retail price of Z10 is around $600-700, comparable to Lumia. So we can reasonably expect the Z10's gross margin to come in higher than Lumia's, most likely at $200 per unit or better. However, for the sake of being conservative, I have applied Lumia's margin of $150/unit into the above analysis for BB10. Software and Services BlackBerry CEO Thorsten Heins made it known in its Q3 earnings conference call that the BB10 operating system will no longer require special BIS plans to operate. This will have a direct negative impact on BlackBerry's service revenues on devices sold to the consumer segment. But all was not lost. Most of the corporate BES fees will remain, and in the long run, BlackBerry should be able to replace lost revenue with new services, not to mention the on-going software revenue coming from their QNX division. Despite all this, I have taken the conservative approach of completely writing off all service revenue from BB10 devices. I have also assumed that 50% of new BB10 devices sold will cannibalize existing BB7 subscribers, and thus reducing the associated BB7 service revenue to $0 for those subscribers. OpEx and Other Items For operating expenses, I have ignored any further savings from BlackBerry's ongoing "CORE" initiative (despite the program's success in controlling costs over the previous few quarters). Also, I have tacked on an additional $1 billion of BB10 launch-related costs. I have used a 23% effective tax rate, taken from their last profitable fiscal year. This company has no debt, so interest expense (if any) is negligible. Bottom Line Despite taking a deliberately conservative approach, it is clear that BlackBerry is still absurdly undervalued under all probable scenarios. I encourage readers to run some numbers themselves using their own assumptions and see if the same conclusion can't be reached. Based on the 3 scenarios and a 10x P/E, the fair value of BBRY ranges between $33.4 to $163.5 per share, or roughly 135% to 1055% return from the current price. Some readers may want to adjust the P/E assumption down to 7x to 8x but the general conclusion will remain the same: BlackBerry is a definite BUY. The math shows that odds are severely skewed to the upside for BlackBerry. Investors who can open up their eyes to the economics behind this business and tune out the daily non-sense spewing from the media will be immensely rewarded.</Msg><Username>orliskas</Username><Timestamp>1361290608698</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 11:16:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361290618463-726</Id><Title>Aapl to $1650</Title><Msg>Or "aapl, the one trillion dollar company".

He even uses an example of creating lies to push Research in Motion's share price down.

Essentially, there are parts of the world where a smartphone is simply a touch screen with an effective web browser, and in those parts of the world, Android is dominating.

I sold some calls to hedge my long position and also bought some puts to protect the downside. Today I am unwinding that trade. I am covering my calls, and selling my puts. I htink APPL has put in a short -term bottom after being down 5 days in row from 485 to 454. I am looking for a bounce back to 468 at this time and then it is no man's game. I will re-hedge then by selling 490 calls and buying 470 puts .Till then enjoy the profits u made if you followed me. I also had a target on GOOG to 800. Which I sold this morning. at 802.

People don't realize how good Apple's numbers really were last quarter. To grow revenue by billions, hit almost the same earnings with a full week less in the quarter and eat all of the costs for launching *several* new products is awfully impressive. Margins will regain traction, there will be a new product or two launched this year (possibly 3 ... iRadio, iWatch and iTV), refreshes of the iPad mini, iMac and iPhone, and possibly a lower cost iPhone specifically for places like China and India (I don't expect we'll see a low cost iPhone in the U.S.). Add in a Docomo and China Mobile signing and you've got a company running on all cylinders. Look for $50+ in earnings and a $650-$750 share price on December 31st.

Vre's where it gets really interesting. As the latest round of 13F filings have fluttered in, hedge funds have been all over the map with regard to Apple AAPL -0.71% . The tech giant was the smart money's top consensus pick at the end of the third quarter, and despite its continued selloff, Soros and his team felt comfortable upping their stake by a little over 115% last quarter. Apple is obviously undervalued, but the key question investors must ask themselves is: can the company expand its investor base? A dividend yield near 2.3% offers a solid payout, but with its overhyped treasure trove of cash, the company can make its shares more attractive to income-oriented investors. It appears that Apple's so-called "secret" hedge fund may be preparing for such a move. Even if a dividend boost or a lengthened share buyback are off the table, Apple still offers better growth prospects than Google GOOG +1.18% , Microsoft MSFT -0.11% and most other large-cap tech companies out there. The sell-side expects Cupertino to average earnings growth of 18%-19% a year over the next half-decade, and a PEG near 0.5 indicates Mr. Market isn't anywhere close to accurately judging this potential.</Msg><Username>matthyatt511</Username><Timestamp>1361295335953</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:35:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361295364249-1057</Id><Title>SVU gives you 4% in a week if you buy and tender the shares</Title><Msg>I don't see any other better way to make sure money. 30% of shares are tendered at $4 which expires on Feb 25.</Msg><Username>zapmaster_the_kinq</Username><Timestamp>1361295364249</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:36:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361295372139-1058</Id><Topic><Title>wait market will sell off after 12 pm Europe close</Title><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361291348748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 11:29:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361295372139</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:36:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361295394420-1059</Id><Title>COOK: SHAREHOLDERS EXTREMELY UPSET WITH AAPL PERFORMANCE GOOG AT 800</Title><Msg>FIRE THS GUY,</Msg><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1361295394420</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:36:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361295394429-1060</Id><Topic><Title>OT: PIR</Title><Username>nosmo_king_01</Username><Timestamp>1361293884368</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:11:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thank you Nosmo!

And so goes the sad lament of the longs who over stayed the party. What is it they refuse to acknowledge? They are down almost 250 points - over 30% - since just September and yort here they are everyday hoping against hope they will be bailed out. The Facts?? Technically the stock is broken badly and remains in a solid downtrend. Deny that and you define yourself as completely ignorant of the technicals. In addition the very real - very serious fundamental issues and concerns per Apple going forward remain. One missed quarter after another. And lower guidance put forth by the company. The $170 million cvash position?? Construed as a "negative" by the players. Highlighting the paralysis of the company's management - or better yet - their mismanagement. The competition is coming very hard now. Samsung's products are highly regarded. Both phones and T.V.'s. The Apple banter a new "watch" - a new T.V?/ After introduction - whoops - when will that be,they will gwet the usual cult suckers to pay "full boat" and then prices AND margins will come down significantly. And so it goes. The long's wishful thinking won't help them. The Apply mystique is yesterday's news. Reality is now on top of it. Just think what happens if the Market corrects 5%-8%. Then agaion you don't want to think a bout it. Just stand there in the middle of the highway as the Reality semi bears down on you.</Msg><Username>crestrider7</Username><Timestamp>1361295942531</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 12:45:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361295943741-1085</Id><Title>AAPL WILL KILL ANDROID THE FRAGMENTED POS.

I sold 471 or so when it faltered, and now I'm buying alittle, now, in case it STOPS going down. Now, I didn't spend ALL I could spend on the position, and instead I'll wait a bit, and if it keeps going up I'll ride it until it falters again, and if it falters, I'll get out with a profit if I have one and try to buy back in lower, or I'll simply hold and wait for that particular position to become profitable while looking for chances to buy lower.

I haven't in years. They sensationalize everything and then have too many blowhards spewing garbage. Apple is out of favor right now with alot of the funds but this will be short lived. The company has proven itself over and over again to be one of the most innovating companies in history and continues to make huge profits. Yet, the media would rather promote a company like Amazon, or even Best Buy right now. And Best Buy is not profotable and will most likely be filing backruptcy in the next couple years.</Msg><Username>deadeye_dopieo</Username><Timestamp>1361300493911</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 14:01:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361300539403-1308</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★WE SAY this Market is PURE "BULL SHEET" !!

I feel bad for the retail unhedged shorts, but Ackman is an idiot if he didn;t take off a bunch since Thursday night, particularly since he is likely still green on the "big short" of his that Icahn calls the prelude to the coming "mother of all short squeezes."

Then the day after the divdend date is past the stock would now fall all of the $60 plus perhaps more because the share of stock now represents $60 less cash in the company that is had before.

Its amazing how the shorts bully you here just for posting a truth that proves aapl will never go down to rediculous levels they post as their opinions. Downside is so limited that I wonder why people are still shorting the stock. It also has such a narrow range right now that there are so many more stocks to short and make money on than aapl. Also the risk that aapl could go up substantially in a day is very real and shouldn't be ignored by people day trading.

If Apple paid a special $60 per share dividend, then you would collect $60 for each sharr you currently own. Who cares if the share price increases? The dividend itself IS the benefit, not a possible increase in the share price. The problem is that so many people you hear arguing against dividends DO NOT OWN the stock. They trade options and so never see any dividend payments, so of course, they prefer a buyback over dividends. But speaking for those of us who actually OWN shares of AAPL, collecting dividends is a benefit independent of what happens to the share price. Hell, with the $60 per share one-time dividend you speculate about, I could buy a house. Not a big house, mind you, but still a house. And I make enough on the current $10.60 a year dividend (which I expect to increase) that it is almost enough to live on. I could quit my job and live on my dividend payments. But he idea of owning stock over the long term and collecting dividends is crazy, I know. ANd for what it's worth, I've been buying AAPL since 2006 and my average purchase price is $193, so I am pretty happy with the stock at around $450 and I can keep collecting dividends while it works its way back up to $600 or higher over the next two to three years (maybe less). If you just started buying within about the last 6 month and you are upset, I understand why you are unhappy, but what can I tell you. You should have started buying 6 years ago instead of 6 months ago.</Msg><Username>gulc94</Username><Timestamp>1361305067014</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:17:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361305072705-1534</Id><Topic><Title>Goog new high..</Title><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1360948569386</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-15 12:16:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If you are complaining about Goog, you need to short FB first..</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1361305072705</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 15:17:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361305073496-1535</Id><Title>My Prediction For AAPL</Title><Msg>Apple will be making cell phones ,in the past with high margins and in the future with low margins.

Isn't the goal of stock ownership to make money? Do dividend payments not count as money? Anyway, the idea that paying a dividend "marked" AAPL as a value stock and not a growth stock is nonsense. Announcing a dividend marked Apple as a company that, at the time of the announcement, had accumulated $98 billion in cash and marketable investments and increasing the dividend next month will "mark" Apple as a company that has, even with the existing dividend, continued to accumulated excess cash now totaling more than $137 billion. Anybody who judges Apple's growth potential based on its payment of dividend's is a fool. One thing has nothing to do with the other. But even if you are correct, I would rather collect dividends which increase year after year and pay me a predictable income stream than hope that the "market" begins to recognize Apple's future growth. Increases in the stock price will come at its own pace. Gimmicks like a buyback will not speed it up. Look at INTC. They have had an aggressive buyback program for years and where has it moved the share price? I actually think that a buyback is a sign of panic in the form of trying to prop-up the share price and I think the market would view it that way. You say a dividend "marks" them as a value company. I say a buyback marks them as lacking confidence the share price will stabilize without some intervention. Meanwhile, sit back, relax, and collect your dividends. Don't forget. You can buy stuff with money earned from dividends too.</Msg><Username>gulc94</Username><Timestamp>1361308401234</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:13:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361308420952-1718</Id><Title>Barbarians at the Gates of the AAPL Kingdom!</Title><Msg>Good this the different ANDROID tribes don't talk to each other LOL!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>bmonte76</Username><Timestamp>1361308420952</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:13:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361308428300-1719</Id><Title>Tim.........

They do. They spend more in 2012 on capital investments than Intel and Google combined. As for acquisitions, they make them, but they are small and strategic. Recall that their acquisition of PA Semiconductor for about $300 million or less, lead to their "A" series chips that power every iOS device. Not THAT was money well spent. I do NOT want to see huge stupid M&amp;A activity just for the sake of spending money. Remember how MSFT reported a quarterly loss last year because they had to write down an $6.5 billion acquisition of a mobile ad company? You might not because CNBC and other kept mentioning their numbers excluding the write-down. THAT was BS. Or maybe Apple should be like HP. Pay $11 billion for a software company and then have to write-down $8.5 billion of that because they overpaid. Or how about their ingenious purchase of Palm, just as it was going out of business, for about $1.5 billion just so they could get WebOS which they then ended-up discontinuing.</Msg><Username>gulc94</Username><Timestamp>1361309064864</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:24:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361309089001-1738</Id><Topic><Title>Buy FB @ 28.4</Title><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1361286221485</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 10:03:41 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>who bought it?</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1361309089001</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:24:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361309090499-1739</Id><Topic><Title>This thing is gonna tank into the toilet next week.</Title><Username>immg_brokerage</Username><Timestamp>1361037400578</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-16 12:56:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yea it can swim where you swim.... dimbulb...</Msg><Username>porchoggs</Username><Timestamp>1361309090499</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:24:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361309109095-1740</Id><Topic><Title>apple stock is interesting</Title><Username>ricnann</Username><Timestamp>1361308157535</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:09:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Get a job douche bag...if you don't have a position, your recycled JUbull #$%$ isn,t welcomed.</Msg><Username>adavidson_nyc</Username><Timestamp>1361309109095</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:25:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361309144617-1741</Id><Title>so what if Eihorn wins case?</Title><Msg>apple will just unbundle the votes and same result... nothing has changed.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1361309144617</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:25:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361309150439-1742</Id><Topic><Title>Market will eventually take AAPL up</Title><Username>aea_student</Username><Timestamp>1361280998223</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 08:36:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>tomorrow the market will do a better job</Msg><Username>aea_student</Username><Timestamp>1361309150439</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:25:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361309161043-1743</Id><Topic><Title>apple stock is interesting</Title><Username>ricnann</Username><Timestamp>1361308157535</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:09:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just another dimbulb you are dimwit... can you loan me some of your millions, since you are SO SMART.. lol</Msg><Username>porchoggs</Username><Timestamp>1361309161043</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:26:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361309223214-1744</Id><Topic><Title>Market will eventually take AAPL up</Title><Username>aea_student</Username><Timestamp>1361280998223</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 08:36:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Better to keep that mouth shut so nobody sees how stupid you really are...</Msg><Username>porchoggs</Username><Timestamp>1361309223214</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:27:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361309224696-1745</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will never reach $500 again.

THis would force Apple to stop hoarding the $140 Billion in cash and the $40 billion of profits, and pay 4% dividend on each share of Preferred Stock it would issue. That with the 2.6% div. you already get on your Common Stock, would together give each shareholder well over 6% per year on capital. A nice return on investment just from dividends.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1361310766745</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:52:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361310847190-1803</Id><Topic><Title>ALERT EINHORN WINS AND THE SOB COOK LOSES, AAPL UP 20 TOMORROW, YES</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1361309411891</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:30:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tamermou,.. the news just reported the US Fed.

Management has already adopted a strategy of maintaining a very large contingency fund. It would be a lot simpler, and less costly to just keep buying back stock at the dips and increase the dividend faster than earnings for a couple of years or so. Classic battle between long-term horizon and the many ultra short-term investors. But, for this (common only) to satisfy investors, they need to believe in the talent and vision of management. At this time, this belief has become weak.</Msg><Username>tomymtnmanzeb</Username><Timestamp>1361314039343</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 17:47:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361314109255-1873</Id><Title>COOK: EITHER GET AAPL BACK TO 700 FAST, OR HIKE DIVIDEND OR GET FIRED</Title><Msg>Unacceptable aapl at years low and goog, samsung , at all time high</Msg><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1361314109255</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 17:48:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361314126885-1874</Id><Topic><Title>Einhorn's plan, is Doable for Apple</Title><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1361312959889</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 17:29:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Actually Einhorn's plan is better for Apple and for Apple stockholders.

The point is AAPL should care about shareholders. I don't even care if Cook does anything, but he needs to be cognizant of the fact that he us the face of the company. AAPL struggled for many years to get recognition by the street. Just don't blow it by doing dumb stuff and calling shareholders sideshow. It sends a negative impression and that's why the stock has been tanking since. Customers/shareholders like to be appreciated. They believe in your product and company enough to invest. You show appreciation not disdain. Cook is wrong for that. I wish he hadn't even said anything and kept his mouth shut if he was going to display such reckless arrogance especially in light of the fact that AAPL stock price has not been performing relative to its peers.</Msg><Username>megaas2000</Username><Timestamp>1361321796490</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 19:56:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361321903931-2028</Id><Title>GOOGLE GOOGLE GOOGLE !!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>THE MAN !!!!1</Msg><Username>overdone234</Username><Timestamp>1361321903931</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 19:58:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361321912052-2029</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer Says Google is New Apple!!</Title><Username>calls_them_as_i_see_them</Username><Timestamp>1361320142997</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 19:29:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>What does his daughter think?

Apple is evolving into an ecosystem, a network that connects to and controls everything from your home to your car to your office. This has the potential to be as impactful as the iPhone and iPad. Today I use iOS apps to control my stereo system (the Sonos) and central air (the Nest). Both work beautifully, and there are more iThings on the way like this incredible door lock. Most of all, I want my television to be part of that Apple ecosystem: a thin glass hub integrating cable series, movies, endless utility and gaming apps, YouTube videos, music, photos, e-mails, FaceTime, social media feeds, and more. I want the TV to be my alarm clock, turning from 'Sleep' mode to awaken me with sweet music, a weather report and news, through an app like the newly launched Winston (which is already optimized for Airplay). Apple needs a television because Apple wants to be a way of life - a management platform to improve the "user experience" of living. As Tim Cook explained last week, Apple is no longer a hardware company. Last quarter Apple generated $3.75 billion in software and services revenue. Imagine the potential for that number to expand when developers can create apps that reinvent our relationship with television screens.

Hear we ago again, and losers like you who had poor parents are soooooooooo misguided.</Msg><Username>defeatsocialism</Username><Timestamp>1361324239725</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 20:37:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361324776965-2053</Id><Title>Am I the only one in the market that realizes...</Title><Msg>the shareholder meeting next week and that it is possible that the dividend could be doubled?

To turn things around they need to deliver a break through product, service or software that is not priced into the stock. An iWatch or Apple TV SDK will due just fine. Until they can deliver something to show they are still innovating, they need to buyback more stock. Using some of the money for the right acquisitions would also be positive. AAPL is still a growth stock, but investors need to know that it will continue to grow by using innovation especially since Steve Jobs is gone.</Msg><Username>nuviphone1</Username><Timestamp>1361325933450</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 21:05:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361326009778-2066</Id><Topic><Title>Am I the only one in the market that realizes...</Title><Username>ajmckay1000</Username><Timestamp>1361324776965</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 20:46:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It wasn't the first letter of a sentence.

We don't have enough assets to pay off the debt either. Do you think the U.S. gov't is going to sell our our federal forests and parks to pay off some of the debt one day? Do you think the gov't is going to sell some of our federal highways to pay off some of the debt? Do you think the Democrats and Obama are going to approve a lot more federal oil permits to pay off some of the debt? Do you think we're going to sell federal buildings to pay off some of the debt? I know Obama and Democrats would love to sell our army, navy, and air force to the communists, but even that wouldn't come close to paying of the debt. The U.S. gov't is broke. They are printing new money to finance the debt to the tune of around $90 billion a month because no one will fund our debt at the current interest rates. We just keep printing more and more and more and more money. The day of reckoning is getting closer and closer.

AAPL is now cheaper then Walmart on a PE basis and it pays the same dividend. That's terrible for a 'innovative' company in the tech sector. This is like saying, there is no growth ahead. The bigger problem is that all the money is chasing GOOG which will soon correct and rotate out into NFLX. These hedge fund managers are so brilliant and creative. I think the only bet for longs is to get enough shorts in this stock to bump it up on a squeeze...all the innovation seems scheduled for Q4 or 2014.

Sure enough, Amazon's sales disappoint, profits are negative (always) and they always miss on the top and bottom line - but the stock always shoots up 20 in the AH and then adds about 10 more over the next few days…this is how the board favorite Chaulkdust got cleaned out. He was blabbing away last year about all the PUTS he bought on Amazon …earnings sucked…but it went up 30 points and he was never heard from again. PUTS are Calls in reverse.

The top five companies by spending last year were Apple, Samsung, HP, Sony, and Dell, but of those only Apple and Samsung actually saw their market share rising; the Korean manufacturer's share grew from 7 per cent in 2011 to 9.3 per cent last year. The duo saw sales increase $6.5bn in 2012, while revenues in the rest of the industry fell by $9.5bn. "While CE remains a dynamic industry the fact is that the stellar growth of the past few years has made growth today more difficult," said Stephen Baker, VP of industry analysis at NPD, in a statement. "Most market segments have high penetration rates and the demand for additional devices is slowing, or declining. Tablets and smartphones have been able to stimulate demand for additional devices, but unfortunately it hasn't been enough, yet, to sustain positive growth trends." Since tablets and smartphones are Apple's hottest items at the moment that's good news for Cupertino, and to a lesser extent for Samsung as it's also heavily invested in both markets. But for players in more established fields such as laptops and desktops, the data makes for grim reading, since it shows how far tablets in particular are cannibalizing sales. Overall consumer electronics sales fell two per cent in 2012, double the rate of decline in 2011. According to the NPD, the sector has had only one quarter of growth in the last two years, but since that came at the end of 2012, things might be looking up. "After struggles with declining categories, and increasingly saturated markets over the last few years, fourth quarter's results may be the first sign that even as a mature industry consumer technology can grow again, albeit with a very different dynamic than in previous growth spurts," concluded Baker. ®</Msg><Username>roop2000</Username><Timestamp>1361327513355</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 21:31:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361327538021-2088</Id><Title>+8 tomorrow</Title><Msg>....maybe</Msg><Username>ajmckay1000</Username><Timestamp>1361327538021</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 21:32:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361327637550-2089</Id><Topic><Title>Lordy..we will classic aapl gap up tomorrow morning</Title><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1361309357684</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 16:29:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pumping</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1361327637550</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 21:33:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361327649869-2090</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL HAS BECOME A JOKE, ALONG WITH COOK</Title><Username>stevegrossostinks</Username><Timestamp>1361326663633</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 21:17:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hey Steve if you really have calls I do feel bad for you.
