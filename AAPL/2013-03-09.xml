Lower opens were bought, you could trade the stock intraday and hold over night and trade your position at a profit. This type of action has been absent almost the entire year. I think it helps some that the biggest vocal bear, Gundlach said he had enough at $425 and took profits. Also with news coming regarding cash, that does put a small "put" under the stock as people wait. They do need to shock and awe with the cash news, the timing has to be good and the result bigger than expected, or the news will just get sold into. AAPL stock needs buyers and aapl needs to step in, in a big way and be the buyer of last resort. They have the money, they have the valuation, there is no reason not to announce a massive share buyback.</Msg><Username>liveup40</Username><Timestamp>1362826627550</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 05:57:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362827802356-17</Id><Topic><Title>Detailed AAPL Research Report.</Title><Username>robert_brooks</Username><Timestamp>1361537786608</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 07:56:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful report</Msg><Username>duenas.helen</Username><Timestamp>1362827802356</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 06:16:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362828462015-18</Id><Topic><Title>SQUAWK BOX to feature AAPL CEO!</Title><Username>bryant_miller</Username><Timestamp>1362509368927</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-05 13:49:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>useful report</Msg><Username>duenas.helen</Username><Timestamp>1362828462015</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 06:27:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362831000592-19</Id><Topic><Title>Jews, they create problems, then drag you into them</Title><Username>roman_warrior_74</Username><Timestamp>1362811614876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 01:46:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>low life anti-semitic bastrd</Msg><Username>michalisrael157</Username><Timestamp>1362831000592</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 07:10:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362832582102-20</Id><Topic><Title>Fallacy of APPLE BEARS</Title><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1361560366151</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:12:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So if we look at the "$Dollars Market Share", Apple had a much higher market share than its 40 or 50% "unit market share" of U.S. Smartphone market shows. The $Dollars Market Share is more relevant, because you're in a business to make money, not to sell product at such low prices there's no profit or even worse to give it away and lose money. In the Emerging Market Countries, Apple's "Unit Market Share" of the entire Smartphone market is lower than USA. But especially there, since more of the phones sold are lower quality and much lower cost, Apple's $Dollar Market Share is much higher than its Unit Market Share % shows. But are the Poor People's unit market share in say India or China worth anything to those making the lower cost phones? The fact is surveys have shown that Apple has 70% of the profits in Smartphones in the world, Samsung has 30%, and all the other companies collectively earn $0 (some earn, but some like Blackberry, Nokia, Motorola, HTC and others making lower cost phones, are losing money,... and some Chinese brands may be growing and making money). So the CHEVROLET / HYUNDAI / NISSAN / YUGO / FIAT end of the market in Smartphones, which Android phones are supplied to, but Apple ignores, collectively doesn't make any money. Its the old 80/20 Rule in Business "80% of the profits come from the top 20% of the market". Apple's got the top 15% of Japan's market now, having recently grown to become the #1 Smartphone brand in Japan, beating out SONY even on its home-turf, and even though Apple phones are more costly. Apple can probably do that in many foreign countries... and rake in double or triple that in "Profits Share" of the Smartphone market.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1362832582102</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 07:36:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362833342179-21</Id><Title>Earnings are on April 23</Title><Msg>IF AAPL is buying back their stock now, this speaks volumes about this date</Msg><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1362833342179</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 07:49:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362833386746-22</Id><Topic><Title>How Can 50 Million Psychos Control The World?</Title><Username>dean_martin_17</Username><Timestamp>1359840484114</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 16:28:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The middle of your post claiming the "1939 Invasion of Germany", by the Allies (Roosevelt, Churchill, Stalin), is a perversion of world history. Its well known that it was #$%$-Germany which started WWII, by its having 'gobbled up Czechoslovakia in 1938, and then militarily invaded Poland in 1939. There are news-reels of German Cruiser Ship in the Polish harbor city of Danzig?, which the Poles let come dock there as part of a suposed Friendly Diplomatic Visit... and the German Cruiser Ship while docked there suddenly started Shelling the Polish City to start the War. The War against Poland in 1939, was also a "stab in the back" again Poland, with the Communist Soviet Union attacking Poland from the other side as well, due to a "friendship non-agression treaty" Hitler's Regime had signed with Stalin. 2 Wolves had a meal on Poland. Then 2 years later, when Hitler decided in 1941 to attack the Soviet Union, he or his foreign minister Ribbentrop was reported to have "ripped up the treaty with Soviet Union" and said "so many scraps of paper", before #$%$ Germany attacked Russia. Stop spreading your lies and propoganda about how Germany was supposely invaded in 1939... its the other way around.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1362833386746</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 07:49:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362833496863-23</Id><Topic><Title>Fallacy of APPLE BEARS</Title><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1361560366151</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-22 14:12:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Be quiet!

Asked about the stock's 41% drop in the last five months, Buffett reminded viewers that Berkshire has tanked by 50% four different times in its history and always came roaring back. Each time, someone advised Buffett to pay a dividend to boost the shares, and each time Buffett demurred. Asked about hedge-fund activist David Einhorn's call for Apple to issue preferred shares, Buffett's counsel was simple. "I would ignore him," he said. "I would run the business to create the most value over the next five or 10 years. You can't run a business to try to run the stock up everyday." CNBC's commentators quickly ignored that patient view and resumed their hand-wringing about Apple after the segment. It was probably of little consequence to them that Apple, like Berkshire, has seen its stock stumble dramatically in the past, such as when it fell as much as 41% between Dec. 28, 2007, and March 3, 2008, just after the iPhone was first introduced. But if the Oracle's words hold no weight, consider some more specific data. Last week I met with Mahi de Silva, who is head of the digital advertising efforts of a little company called Opera Software, listed on the Oslo exchange (OPERA.Norway). Opera is best known for a Web browser that can be run on desktops, smartphones, and tablet computers. That in itself might be of little interest to readers. But because Opera bought de Silva's start-up, AdMarvel, in 2010, the company now also runs the advertising infrastructure for 20 of the top 25 publishers on mobile devices, including The Wall Street Journal and Barron's. The Barron's iPad app was created using Opera's technology, and every time you see an ad amidst our priceless content, that's Opera at work. To get back to Apple, de Silva says that out of the roughly $1 billion in gross advertising dollars the company facilitated for us and other publishers last year, 40% of the volume of ad impressions came from Apple's devices versus just 30% for devices running Google's (GOOG) Android operating system. How can it be that Apple's devices generate so much more ad activity, when Apple has just 22% of smartphone sales and the vast majority is controlled by Android? "Android users are a bit geeky," says de Silva. By which he means the average user of an Android smartphone or tablet is less likely to download and use the apps provided by Dow Jones and other premiere publishers that create the ad inventory that advertisers crave. When I asked de Silva if that might change if Apple were to drop to, say, 15% of smartphone sales, he was inclined to think not. That audience on Apple's iOS is highly valuable, even if the overall smartphone numbers shift. The cost-per-thousand, or CPM, in fact, for ads on iOS is about 25% higher than on Android, he said. In other words, Apple's gadgets are a platform on which the high-value consumers gather, and where the high-value publishers and advertisers focus their efforts. All three constituents tend to build the value of Apple's software in the way that they meet up. And so, the next time someone says that the iPhone doesn't have the largest screen, or that other tablet computers are cheaper, remember that when it comes to making business sense on these devices, Apple still seems to be at the front of the pack.</Msg><Username>ericshinisbig</Username><Timestamp>1362835109643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:18:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362835123546-27</Id><Topic><Title>Jews, they create problems, then drag you into them</Title><Username>roman_warrior_74</Username><Timestamp>1362811614876</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 01:46:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GFUglyMother as you all ARABS love to do</Msg><Username>mashiach</Username><Timestamp>1362835123546</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:18:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362835363418-28</Id><Topic><Title>Positive article on AAPL ad revenue in Barrons this week</Title><Username>ericshinisbig</Username><Timestamp>1362835109643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:18:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The name of the article is( Four Chip Stocks That Could Rebound; Apple Economics)if you want to Google it.</Msg><Username>ericshinisbig</Username><Timestamp>1362835363418</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:22:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362835470822-29</Id><Title>In last 6 weeks AAPL is down by $7</Title><Msg>ttttttttttttttt</Msg><Username>tendulrocks</Username><Timestamp>1362835470822</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:24:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362835590925-30</Id><Topic><Title>Positive article on AAPL ad revenue in Barrons this week</Title><Username>ericshinisbig</Username><Timestamp>1362835109643</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 08:18:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"CNBC commentators quickly ignored that patient and resumed their hand-wringing about apple after the segment" Thats funny and true......

A big drop in shipments is expected for the June quarter, followed by Sep. quarter growth. The big question for Apple is whether an iPhone 5S that keeps a 4" display (as has been reported) will lead to a major sales pickup in the face of growing demand for larger displays, and the upcoming launch of Samsung's Galaxy S IV. However, an early 5S release would suggest an accelerated launch for an iPhone 6 rumored to have a bigger display.</Msg><Username>tomsaga25</Username><Timestamp>1362838000756</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 09:06:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362838031481-40</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL on SQUAWK BOX!</Title><Username>november_jason</Username><Timestamp>1362658177793</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-07 07:09:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cool</Msg><Username>paulwickson777</Username><Timestamp>1362838031481</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 09:07:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362838421521-41</Id><Title>CNBC and Cramer need to be held accountable but..</Title><Msg>BIg Banks make billions in illegal profits then are penalized a few million.

Agencies and Corporate (Enterprise) users, who need high security. Only Apple and Blackberry have their own Operating Systems. The ANDROID system (used by Samsung, HTC, Sony, Amazon, Motorola...and more) can never be really "secure" because the Software Code for it has been given out by GOOGLE to 20 different cellphone manufacturers in tons of countries. You can be sure each countries' CIA has a copy of the Android Software code. Plus Android Software itself is made from JAVA Software, which is Open Software, that any computer hacker or student can get the original software code for. AGAIN, ONLY APPLE AND BLACKBERRY HAVE PROPRIETARY SMARTPHONE OPERATING SYSTEMS, SO ONLY THOSE TWO SYSTEMS CAN PROVIDE THE SECURITY GOVERN.

IBM's products and services are used by most of the big businesses and governments around the world. Without IBM, people won't get their tax refunds and social security checks. People won't be able to withdraw cash from ATM and traders can't even trade AAPL. IBM's business is predictable and people are willing to pay for the predictability and award it a higher PE. Apple is in gadget business which is very unstable. It is either grow or die. If it doesn't grow, it may not be able to maintain its cash-flow. Just look at PALM, NOK, MOT, RIM,... Apple might be different but no one can be certain. And this is the kind of uncertain future which keeps its PE down.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1362844066254</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 10:47:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362844102042-71</Id><Topic><Title>Apple Vs.

All of you shorts have been pushing for this filling of the 420 gap of jan 2012, and you've got that. 420 was also a ceiling in 2011 tested multiple times. We have seen 2 double bottoms that didn't hold... Around 505, and 435. Both had about a 10% pop afterwards but couldn't really break the 20 day sma. Now we have a 5 day ascending wedge which hopefully leads to a pop above the 20 day towards the 50 day. About the capitulation needed, I'm hoping that since we've seen outright selling for 5 months will just run into seller exhaustion and it won't happen. Volume has been pretty pathetic, so you might be right. If you go back to oct 2011 and the earnings miss at $7 with $25 bill rev, you would think that $10 and 40 bill rev would keep it above 420</Msg><Username>call_sprds</Username><Timestamp>1362849301320</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 12:15:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362849885932-109</Id><Topic><Title>Mossad Link Found to One of Key 9-11 Hijackers</Title><Username>roman_warrior_74</Username><Timestamp>1362849197399</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 12:13:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>roman_warrior, you sound like one of those conspiracy theorists who think the U.S. government blew up the World Trade Center building.

"Apple's (AAPL) Rumored Streaming Radio Launch Now Delayed - NYT March 7, 2013 1:05 PM EST According to the NY Times, Apple's (Nasdaq: AAPL) alleged streaming radio service is said to be delayed. The Times cites people familiar with the matter in saying the service, which had previously been expected to be released within a few months, won't debut until sometime over the summer at earliest. The delay may be due to licensing negotiations with music labels, which was earlier said to be on rocky ground. Apple may have even planned to debut the service during the 2013 Grammys. The Times stated that Apple may have also hit a speed bump with a key publisher in Sony/ATV, which controls the EMI publishing catalog."</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362874087752</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 19:08:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362874122166-193</Id><Topic><Title>Apple should buy Ford, Nexflix and SiriusXM</Title><Username>johnnycuckhold</Username><Timestamp>1362872214216</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 18:36:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>While you're at it buy some oil company and a healthcare company too. #$%$</Msg><Username>vogue1254</Username><Timestamp>1362874122166</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 19:08:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362874426668-194</Id><Topic><Title>CNN Money - "The Hypocracy of White Trash Males sucking the JEWISHdeick."</Title><Username>muphet_boy</Username><Timestamp>1362862180632</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 15:49:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Incontrovertible evidence of JEWsheit manipulation - the 300 point collaborated drop.</Msg><Username>e.staws</Username><Timestamp>1362874426668</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 19:13:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362874537311-195</Id><Topic><Title>White men buy shares.

Look it up. Whatever the case, the point is that Apple's competitors are once again coordinating their efforts, and looking to divide and conquer. Meanwhile, Apple stubbornly maintains an "us against the world" attitude. Apple has Google attacking from one side and a syndicate of hardware manufacturers on the other. How long can Apple realistically fight on both fronts and expect to win? Sure, Apple has an uncanny ability for making comebacks and is chock full of innovation, but even that has limits. Word on the street is that Apple's next big thing is an "iWatch." Who's banking a wrist watch revolution? The bottom line, I think the recent correction in Apple was necessary, and priced in more reasonable expectations. At under $450, I think Apple may even be a bit undervalued. Based on average analyst earnings estimates, I would approximate fair value to be around $520. There may be some value there, but I seriously doubt that Apple will rocket its way back to $705 anytime soon. Anyone salivating over the thought of doubling up quickly may want to take a big, juicy bite out of something other than Apple, in my opinion.</Msg><Username>calls_them_as_i_see_them</Username><Timestamp>1362886369338</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 22:32:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362886467544-230</Id><Title>Yahoo will not let type about samdungfungsung on board about s Korea spy games!</Title><Msg>Just like Vietnam</Msg><Username>kdkellyllc</Username><Timestamp>1362886467544</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 22:34:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362886615839-231</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL trading alert</Title><Username>tfltrading</Username><Timestamp>1362792774032</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 20:32:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, I have explained to readers on this board many times.

Using Enron leads one to think they're all going to zero, which obviously very rarely happens. Apple will eventually break out of this negative feedback loop but it could take a while.

AAPL this year will tranform so net will be flat for the year but for next year a 51-55$ is a 15-25%growth in net rev 210-220B$ is a 20% rev growth does this company deserves a PE of 4-5? What a B^^^S market no company growing 20% is trading at PE of 5. NKE WMT JJ KO IBM all grow 1-5% and gets a PE of 15 MSFT who grows net negative and rev by 5% gets a PE of 15 DELL who is basicaly a broke company PC is dead gets a PE higher than AAPL HPQ run 50% because losses were smaller than thoght wow they lose and gets a 50% POP. AMZN is leading the market absurd PE of 300 they almost never post a net ,they always claiim they are investing oit in business for year and the markets and stupid media eat this.</Msg><Username>michalisrael157</Username><Timestamp>1362890103282</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-09 23:35:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362890529378-256</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL trading alert</Title><Username>tfltrading</Username><Timestamp>1362792774032</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-08 20:32:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No, I exited Long, and stayed in Cash at last trading day's close.
