You are about to win big because Samsung is on offense now and are going to go all out invalidating Apples valuable patents and exposing their secrets to the public. The stock started heading south today when Samsung virtually invalidated Apples "pinch to zoom" patent by showing prior art. Much more to come. You shorted at just the right time. On top of that, iPhone sales missed expectations badly last quarter. Apple blamed anticipation for iPhone 5, but that is a huge load of nonsense. 99% of consumers arent Apple investors reading tech blogs every day. They arent looking 6 months out for the next iphone. Sales were sluggish because everyone is moving to Android because it is a more open platform with less restrictions.</Msg><Username>musichead2005</Username><Timestamp>1345008552186</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 01:29:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345009144626-11</Id><Topic><Title>APPLE,SAMSUNG Trial- WORLD IS Saying one of the most RIGGED ,BIASED trials in history next to O.J Simpson trial.</Title><Username>fgtd100</Username><Timestamp>1345000555915</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 23:15:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey, #$%$ why not disclosing your true name and address instead of hiding under the skirt of a pseudonym?

Samsung apparently doesn't want to comply with U.S. intellectual property law, nor with the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure in cases before federal courts in the U.S. In addition, the judge denied the testimony of various Samsung expert witness BECAUSE they were not disclosed to Apple in sufficient time before the trial to perform proper discovery. This is a very serious violation of the discovery rules. Our system is not based on surprising the adversary at trial despite what you may have seen on television.</Msg><Username>atangolover</Username><Timestamp>1345011184908</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 02:13:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345016253600-15</Id><Topic><Title>iPhone 4S Sales Are So Bad, Sprint Giving 100 Gift Card w Purchase...</Title><Username>shortinguy</Username><Timestamp>1345015807590</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 03:30:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't it just because the launch of iPhone5 is approaching?</Msg><Username>supermarrox</Username><Timestamp>1345016253600</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 03:37:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345020475586-16</Id><Title>Samdung will lose the case and have to take a greasy Sanchez up the backdoor anail sphincter. lol!</Title><Msg>gggggggggg</Msg><Username>adiosgroidcare</Username><Timestamp>1345020475586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 04:47:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345021679423-17</Id><Topic><Title>Samdung will lose the case and have to take a greasy Sanchez up the backdoor anail sphincter. lol!</Title><Username>adiosgroidcare</Username><Timestamp>1345020475586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 04:47:55 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe you would like to reword that post</Msg><Username>lucenatraveler</Username><Timestamp>1345021679423</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 05:07:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345022907247-18</Id><Title>THE NEW LITTLE APPLE ARENA ITS BILLION DOLLAR STOCK ON SALE FOR $8</Title><Msg>The new pill that will help cure diabetic and obesity 42%of the population will be obesit by 2030 its million 79 mil have diabetes 1 in 400 children has diabetes ; belviq is the cure ;buy ou coming or merger; regards</Msg><Username>frankiepro917</Username><Timestamp>1345022907247</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 05:28:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345023915392-19</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL: Time to buy?</Title><Username>jamesgordon99</Username><Timestamp>1343307826032</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-07-26 09:03:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thanks a lot for all congratulations!</Msg><Username>jamesgordon99</Username><Timestamp>1345023915392</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 05:45:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345023995379-20</Id><Title>OK...who bought at $633 ??.... bwhahahahahahaha....you'll lose your ACE son !!</Title><Msg>REALLY !</Msg><Username>horseseven_7</Username><Timestamp>1345023995379</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 05:46:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345024118207-21</Id><Title>ALL US "Shorties" are back in town for the BIG HAUL OF $$$$$$$$$$$ ....easy money boys from these APPLEHEADS !</Title><Msg>woooooooooooooohooooooooooooooooooooooooo !!!</Msg><Username>horseseven_7</Username><Timestamp>1345024118207</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 05:48:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345024565868-22</Id><Title>New high Today.</Title><Msg>aaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaaa</Msg><Username>arthurkhach</Username><Timestamp>1345024565868</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 05:56:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345024831996-23</Id><Topic><Title>AEA, Do your client's know you're breaking confidentiality?</Title><Username>genesis_gekko</Username><Timestamp>1301593438000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2011-03-31 13:43:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sure his mother won't mind.</Msg><Username>tradd.devlin</Username><Timestamp>1345024831996</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 06:00:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345025161507-24</Id><Title>justin Samsung accuses Apple of infringing on three patents</Title><Msg>Published: 06:27 PM EST (03:27 PM PST) Samsung on Tuesday moved forward with arguments in its case against Apple, going on the offensive by alleging the iPhone maker infringed on three patents regarding the usability of multi-feature portable devices like smartphones. Harvard professor and patent specialist Woodward Yang, was called to the stand as Samsung's fourth witness, gave testimony regarding three patents owned by the South Korean company covering photos, email attachments and playing music in the background. According to in-court reports from CNET, Yang claims to have spent some 300 to 400 hours researching Apple devices for trial purposes, alleging certain models of the iPhone, iPad and iPod touch infringe on Samsung's patents. During his testimony, Yang demoed a photo emailing patent by showing Apple's iDevices sending pictures taken of an orange. According to the witness, the invention was designed with feature phones in mind, doing away with the hassle of connecting the device to a computer to offload photos. It is unclear if the patent covers Apple's integrated photo sharing options. In another photo-related patent claim, Samsung asserted a photo album patent where a user can bookmark a specific photo for later viewing. Yang demoed the allegedly infringed feature on the iPhone 3GS, iPhone 4, iPad 2 and fourth-generation iPod touch, all of which presented the same image when bringing up a photo roll in an app other than Apple's default Photos. Finally, Samsung asserted a patent which describes a software solution for music to be played in the background behind other open apps. Yang notes the idea for the claim was to find a way to keep music playing when switching through apps, while keeping device size down by not introducing decoding hardware. In cross-examination, Apple lawyer Bill Lee went on the offensive, referencing a page from Samsung's side-by-side comparison of the iPhone and what would would become the Galaxy S, saying the Korean company studied Apple's implementation of email attachments. "In your 400 hours of work, you have not found one iota of evidence that Apple knew about the '893 patent, or copied the '893 patent," Lee said in reference to the photo album feature. Yang said the assertion was true.</Msg><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1345025161507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 06:06:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345025625918-25</Id><Topic><Title>RUMORS ABOUT IPAD AIR, NEXUS 7 KILLER, AAPL UP 12 TOMORROW</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1345010487578</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 02:01:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agreed but as i said before the new sleeper product will be the ipad mini over the iphone 5, Think about it going against amzn and all the other crappy tablets with a quality built ipad at around 200 bucks.they're going to sell a friggin billion of them,,</Msg><Username>robpic5</Username><Timestamp>1345025625918</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 06:13:45 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345025899948-26</Id><Topic><Title>shorted 1400shs aapl at 632.35 ah (for myself)</Title><Username>sonw_32</Username><Timestamp>1344985837010</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 19:10:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>sonw_2d</Username><Timestamp>1345025899948</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 06:18:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345026251965-27</Id><Title>nobody know why apple drop $8.40 in few hours yesterday ?</Title><Msg>ggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>sonw_2d</Username><Timestamp>1345026251965</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 06:24:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345026348559-28</Id><Title>Apple's sept 12 iphone 5 launch can add up to 10 mil phones sold tis qt.</Title><Msg>BA BA BA BOOYA! now Tim lowered Apple sales for the qt and watch another blowout in the making.</Msg><Username>robpic5</Username><Timestamp>1345026348559</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 06:25:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345026392983-29</Id><Topic><Title>Bernanke warns Ron Paul's Fed audit bill could cause 'nightmare scenario' --------- stablishing a system in which the Fed's monetary policy moves could be immediately called into question by lawmakers would have a "chilling effect" on the institution and generally reduce its ability to help steer the economy, he warned.</Title><Username>stem_osir</Username><Timestamp>1344806741014</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-12 17:25:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Most Americans thing the Fed is a govt institution, largely because of a complicit mass media.

That statement presents a bit of a conundrum doesn't it? Because without an UPDATED model, based on current market metrics and global economics, the old model from one year ago prior to the parabolic price moves on Apple's stock creates results that are ~quite~ skewed. Gene Munster's predicted run rate hasn't accounted for the glut of other market offerings, but seems to take for granted that brand loyalty alone will be enough to inspire current iPhone users to upgrade?? I look forward to seeing a revision of Piper Jaffray's "MATH" after they have updated their model, but for all intents and purposes this article with it's IRRELEVANT predictions comes across as just another attempt to prop up Apple's stock. What I'd like to know is: IS PIPER JAFFRAY BUYING APPLE STOCK, OR DISTRIBUTING APPLE STOCK? This question wasn't addressed in the article. That question is something every investor better consider.</Msg><Username>mount_fuji_backside</Username><Timestamp>1345028609879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 07:03:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345029094641-34</Id><Topic><Title>Open Letter to PIPER JAFFRAY - FORTUNE article - iPhone 5 projections</Title><Username>mount_fuji_backside</Username><Timestamp>1345028609879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 07:03:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Appleheads will upgrade based on 4g and a larger screen,imho,, i know i will</Msg><Username>robpic5</Username><Timestamp>1345029094641</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 07:11:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345029109130-35</Id><Topic><Title>shorted 1400shs aapl at 632.35 ah (for myself)</Title><Username>sonw_32</Username><Timestamp>1344985837010</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-08-14 19:10:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>sonw_2d</Username><Timestamp>1345029109130</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 07:11:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345029130637-36</Id><Topic><Title>If davidch14 is a jury Samsung already hung on the tree and killed on the first day of the trial.</Title><Username>sonw_2d</Username><Timestamp>1345027445225</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 06:44:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And if were up to AEA, aapl lost and stock falls to 570...So that is what makes a market...yes</Msg><Username>valueplay_2000</Username><Timestamp>1345029130637</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 07:12:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345029282618-37</Id><Title>Can They Give That Much Power To One Company</Title><Msg>If The Judge Is Smart We Need To Have International Competition.

Also, I think Lord Chatterly was trying to convince you to go long on Monday two days ago--after you tried to convince him to go short. Did you take his advice or did you miss Monday too? Now that we`ve broken the upper trend line channel, tested the previous ATH close and broken the upper envelope 5SDs above the 22EMA, it might not be unreasonable to look for a good pull-back.

It's always been my understanding that one who alleges to be truthful in their reporting shouldn't use their media position to promote or demote any specific company or stock. Genuine, truthful reporters won't allow a bias to enter into their work. I guess you've noticed by now that Philip Elmer-DeWitt at CNNMoney/Tech is completely and overwhelmingly biased PRO-APPLE? Not very professional of him in my opinion, but then again, that is just one person's opinion. Perhaps Apple shareholders LIKE wearing rose colored glasses and favor the stance of an ostrich holding its head under the sand? Do all shareholders want to read ONLY that material which gives them warm-fuzzy feelings? Are you one of those? As to trades, as I've said, I have my perspective on this stock, the MEDIA PUMPING behind it, the crooks on the street manipulating it, and I have absolutely no problem in telling you that I am short to the gills, including various PUT strikes. I've been in and out, but I ALWAYS have a short/PUT position(s) in play. Thank you for the opportunity to bring this post to the top of the message list.

Later on in the 1990s, Bill Clinton, another Democrat, passed laws to enforce the original bill. The purpose of the CRA is to force banks to make risky loans to people who can’t afford to repay those loans. Timeline of the events in the crisis: Bush was the first to recommend regulating the GSEs in April, 2001. In 2003, Bush tried to create a new federal agency to regulate the GSEs. He was blocked from doing so by the Democrats in the Senate, especially by Barney Frank. In 2005, Alan Greenspan warned that failing to regulate the GSEs could be a catastrophe. Again, Democrats blocked the effort to regulate Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Democrat Chuck Schumer protesting that regulation is not needed. In 2006, McCain and other Republicans introduced a bill to regulate the GSEs. Again, the Democrats voted against it and nothing happened. . Fannie Mae CEO addresses Democrats: Fannie Mae CEO calling Obama and the Dems the “Family” and “Conscience” of Fannie Mae. The Democrats obstructed the regulation of the GSEs while taking political contributions from them, especially Obama. Franklin Raines, Jamie Gorelick and Jim Johnson were all executives at the GSEs and are all Democrats. Other Democrats like Penny Pritzker ran other mortgage banks into the ground, and now work for Obama. Obama himself sued banks on behalf of ACORN, to force the banks to make these risky loans. Obama sued Citibank under the Community Reinvestment Act in a typical ACORN-style lawsuit to force the bank to make these risky loans. ACORN filed many of this type of lawsuit alleging racism in all of them. Obama was also the second-highest recipient of political contributions from the GSEs.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1345036690807</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 09:18:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345036691210-87</Id><Topic><Title>Most important this week ...Don't fight the Big Boys, You will pay dearly</Title><Username>aea_dm2</Username><Timestamp>1345034454549</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 08:40:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>market hasn't really dropped yet.... can't break 1400</Msg><Username>bjohn57900</Username><Timestamp>1345036691210</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 09:18:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345036829128-88</Id><Title>Gartner STATS on Mobile Phone sales - iPhone/Samsung</Title><Msg>"In the second quarter of 2012, Samsung's mobile phone sales remained very strong — up 29.5 percent from the second quarter of 2011 (see Table 1), and managed to extend its lead over both Apple and Nokia quarter on quarter. This quarter's growth was driven by record sales of Galaxy smartphones, meaning smartphones now account for 50.4 percent of all Samsung mobile devices, or 45.6 million units. Demand for the new Galaxy S3 was particularly strong, exceeding Samsung's own expectations, with a reported 10 million units reached in the two months after its release. The Galaxy S3 was the best-selling Android product in the quarter and could have been higher but for product shortages.

It encouraged banks and mortgage lenders to loan money for housing to people who would not otherwise qualify (with Freddie and Fannie backing same by taking the paper). 1995: President Clinton signed the executive order mandating lenders expand their lending for mortgages to sub-prime borrowers (that means people who would not qualify under any criteria in a sane world). Failure to do so would result in the lending institution not having access to federal funds or the quasi governmental Fannie and Freddie. 2003: President Bush tried to get congress to amend Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac rules to disallow loans to people who would not qualify under normal lending institution rules for making loans. In other words, rescind the Clinton Executive order which had by now become the rules of Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae. The Democrats in the Senate (48) used the threat of filibuster to kill the bill (got to have that magic 60 in the Senate to stop a filibuster). 2006: Greenspan testified before congress that Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac were both a house of cards and needed a lot more oversight and controls in case this country found itself in a recession in the future. That duty falls to the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs. Democrat Chris Dodd is Chairman. He wasn't thrilled with Greenspan's advice, because he was the number one campaign money receiver from Fannie and Freddie over the years. Obama was number 2, and he raked in his amount in just the past two years.</Msg><Username>texexec60</Username><Timestamp>1345037116162</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 09:25:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345037126884-91</Id><Topic><Title>Is Apple getting ready to launch an 'iPad Air'?</Title><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1345032683937</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 08:11:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not sure...

The new subprime loans were designed to fail. They were predicated on continuing raising home prices. By putting borrowers in a position where they had to refinance every two years, the engineers of these loans hoped to capture some of the price gains for themselves through fees associated with refinancing. This statement was made at the NASP (National Association of Securities Professionals) last month. In attendance were representatives from Goldman Sachs, Chase, JP Morgan, Morgan Stanley and other investment banks. No one disputed this claim. They basically pointed out that they were in pension management and were independent from the mortgage divisions in their respective companies.</Msg><Username>sulsky1</Username><Timestamp>1345038451623</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 09:47:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345038536280-104</Id><Title>645 today?</Title><Msg>All time high..

AAPL... we are looking to buy it at 623-625... if it fails then it can go lower to the 617-support-619-area... below that is the 608-support-area ...the market continues to to slop-and-chop and we said yesterday that the 10-SPX-Handle-Drop set the LONGs into biting their nails... yesterday we saw investors thinking the market has come up so far like 50-SPX-Handles in so little time and traders like bjohn can't believe this is happening and he is very common thinker of the shorts-mentality... but we urge you all to hear us out before making a final-answer on who wants to be a billionaire... cuz if you step-back and look at the chart... the market for fact has not budged either direction for over a week's worth of trading... and that should tell you something... but at the same time the LONGs can't ignore that the Russell2000 RUT has not been up very much the past 2 weeks... less than 25% of the time has it been up while the SPX has hung in there... so the small-caps have had a small-pullback and we think you are all being fooled cuz you are not reading the tape correctly... you are all watching the big-stocks like AAPL and GOOG but have you really given the RUT any thought?... lucky for you we have done your homework... but then again we ask the LONGs why you think the market is so strong if the RUT can't rally... doesn't look as strong as the LONGs think either... sorta a conundrum?... SPX is unch from over a week ago... so don't get thrown off you thoughts and try to stick to what the chart is telling you... in addition the McClellan Oscar-Later hasn't posted a new high above the previous high... looks like it has lost is luster and it has been 2 days so if the S&amp;P 500 don't get off its tail and begin an up-move then the Oscar-Later will turn-over and pull a lesser-high which becomes a Neggy-Diverge... and the # of new-highs on the board has been slipping and LONGs don't like to see this fact... so we have to issue a warning at this juncture... we are getting close to the total top but we still believe the top is not in yet but it is near-the-end... the biggest part of the SPX move the past year may be coming to a close... could the rally be over? not sure yet... the Oscar-Later did hit an over-sold point on the start of AUGUST... but technical reading requires us to give it 2-more-trading-days before we can wave the white-flag and say it is done and a lower-high will be formed... so now we may be setting up 2 Neggy-Diverges... the Oscar-Later and the Lack-of-New-Highs and that pairing is not wrong too often... ...also the 30-day-avg-advance-decline-line has been in a lowering-pattern since the start-of-July... maybe that is why the RUT is struggling?... check the chart if you don't believe us... now at the same time this is not a fantastic over-sold-indicator but it is worth noting and we need to watch if it sets-in-a-lower-or-high-high... if it doesn't set a new-high then we will have a total of 3 major indicators that spells problems for the market... ...now before we get bjohn salivating... let's review a few positives in this market... 2 charts we watch on sentimental-buyers have not out-done themselves quite yet... so there is plenty of new money that is willing to throw more into this blind-trust that the economy is doing just fine... so keep in mind this let's talk VIX... we said yeterday... for more than a half-a-decade it needs to set-up a double-bottom... and sometimes it has to pull a Trip-Dip... a Trip-Dip is 3 Bottoms... this the name Tripple-Dipple... but for us we have only seen side-stepping on the VIX and it is neutral at this time... so we have not bought the VXX in any sizable trade yet ...more postings to come... we are very behind today cuz we are getting lots of trades done... we be back soon</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1345041824203</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 10:43:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345041838373-156</Id><Title>VIX GOING UP !!!

Longs are desperate to get over 1410-area... and try to get up to 1415-area... but FunnieBucket we have no desire to short the market at any sizable method right now there is more attempts to fail 1410 and 1415 but the shorts rejection yesterday won't allow the market to go past 1410 today Shorts Scenario today is... got a big help yesterday but needs more selling below 1400-area... then can go to 1397 and this is the key level they are all watching... then below that is 1390 today Longs Scenario today is... obviously the bind the longs are in is the break-over-1410 is looking rather tough... and the only way to beat the shorts today is to get over 1410 and beat up on the shorts with a slow-grind-up to 1415... but goodluck with that today cuz we doubt it will happen... but on the other hand if the longs hold over 1400-area then there is a chance to re-test-1410 today</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1345044329879</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:25:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345044359737-176</Id><Title>george raes gij vettige verkeerde die verkeerde denkt dat hem britney spears kan krijgen</Title><Msg>onthoofden die #$%$</Msg><Username>germanroll77</Username><Timestamp>1345044359737</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:25:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345044453351-177</Id><Title>iPhone 5 - $750 here come!</Title><Msg>Very, Very SOON</Msg><Username>sbull1751</Username><Timestamp>1345044453351</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:27:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345044463521-178</Id><Topic><Title>$12 Billion Fund Sells Cisco, Buys Apple</Title><Username>badtrader999</Username><Timestamp>1345043281715</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:08:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>badtrader999</Username><Timestamp>1345044463521</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:27:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345044613869-179</Id><Topic><Title>$12 Billion Fund Sells Cisco, Buys Apple</Title><Username>badtrader999</Username><Timestamp>1345043281715</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:08:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When?</Msg><Username>aaplretiree</Username><Timestamp>1345044613869</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 11:30:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345044622058-180</Id><Title>OH NoOOOo!!!

By Bryan Bender and Brian MacQuarrie , Globe Staff JANESVILLE, Wisc. — In 2009, as Rep. Paul D. Ryan was railing against President Obama’s $787 billion stimulus package as a “wasteful spending spree,” he wrote at least four letters to Obama’s secretary of energy asking that millions of dollars from the program be granted to a pair of Wisconsin conservation groups, according to documents obtained by the Globe. The advocacy appeared to pay off; both groups were awarded the economic recovery funds -- one receiving a $20 million grant to help thousands of local businesses and homes improve their energy efficiency, agency documents show. Ryan’s letters to the energy secretary praising the energy initiatives as he sought a portion of the funding are in sharp contrast to the House Budget Committee chairman’s image as a Tea Party favorite adamantly opposed to federal spending on such programs. Ryan’s views are garnering new attention since his selection Saturday as Mitt Romney’s running mate. The documents show that Ryan’s attempts to take advantage of the stimulus funds even after he voted against them was more expansive than previously reported. Ryan was criticized by some House Democrats in 2010 after the Wall Street Journal reported that he was among several Republicans lawmakers who sought the stimulus money for their constituents by, in his case, writing a letter in 2010 to the Department of Labor.

The additional letters include his praise for the energy program’s aims, and clash with his own budget priorities, which call for curtailing many of the same Department of Energy investments that are designed to spur the growth of green technologies and reduce reliance on fossil fuels.. “I was pleased that the primary objectives of their project will allow residents and businesess in the partner cities to reduce their energy costs, reduce greenhouse gas emissions, and stimulate the local economy by creating new jobs,” Ryan wrote to Energy Secretary Steven Chu on December 18, 2009, on behalf of the Wisconsin Energy Conservation Corporation.</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1345050487249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:08:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345050506307-296</Id><Title>Good opportunity....</Title><Msg>to buy on this dip, which will be mash temporary.... that is the Truce!!!!</Msg><Username>matthyatt511</Username><Timestamp>1345050506307</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:08:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345050519268-297</Id><Topic><Title>too late now</Title><Username>aea_32</Username><Timestamp>1345050063016</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:01:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You mean that's it?

Until we see a sell on volume closer to the daily average and above this is noting but a small speed bump. Sell out to the manipulators and you will be sorry. AAPL will POP $30 or more when the September Conference gets officially accounced. I do however believe that AAPL will drop big time in mid-September as the focus goes from new products to the next earnings. That's when you need to get out and wait until after earnings for the next POP.</Msg><Username>genetaranto</Username><Timestamp>1345052806651</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:46:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345052893479-363</Id><Title>it took while to go over 13,000 and 1400....</Title><Msg>now as we consolidate, dont worry, relax and wait for baby to arrive...</Msg><Username>matthyatt511</Username><Timestamp>1345052893479</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:48:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345052987937-364</Id><Title>Apple stock collapsing as Samsung will win lawsuit and all things Apple crumble</Title><Msg>Very bad today down 10</Msg><Username>aapl2013</Username><Timestamp>1345052987937</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:49:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345053075957-365</Id><Topic><Title>Apple stock collapsing as Samsung will win lawsuit and all things Apple crumble</Title><Username>aapl2013</Username><Timestamp>1345052987937</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:49:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>day after day same sh.t......dont you ever pack em up and throw in the towel</Msg><Username>martikkkins</Username><Timestamp>1345053075957</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 13:51:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345053092316-366</Id><Topic><Title>Relax Longs.

One never ever buys front-month out-of-the-money options as their primary stake in the game. Obviously, that is what you must have done, or you wouldn't have experienced the time degradation to the value of your option on a down day, and gotten "nothing". It's either that, or you entered the put option position at the bottom of an intraday range. If that is what you purchased, and your front month OTM options strike is part of a calculated spread, then that is COOL if you are COOL with potentially tossing it... I've played ridiculous OTM calls &amp; puts at times, and actually bagged a few overnight 2000%, but it's very rare, and my risk was lunch money, so not much was ever really realized from it. Anyway, stick with deep in-the-money options, especially if you are playing the front month. If you can't afford the ITM options on a $600+ stock, then find another issue to trade, and don't destroy your buying power trying to swing for the fence with an OTM option. I'm not bashing you, but old men have tales to tell, humor to share, and experience. If I can save you from getting a mortal financial wound (even if it #$%$ you off to hear it) then so be it. Sincere wishes for good luck to you tomorrow... Fuji PS -- it's always best to exit a losing options trade QUICKLY and regroup. You'll make up for it better once you have identified your mistake..</Msg><Username>mount_fuji_backside</Username><Timestamp>1345067211611</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-15 17:46:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345067322020-566</Id><Topic><Title>VIX lower...

Also note the discount of the 4s...it is positioned price-wise to be an on-going available item, as it has not been fully discounted. Aapl will be able to maintain better margins on the 4s moving forward. The 4s will be to the I-5 as the I-Pad 2 is to the I-Pad 3.

I'm glad that there are perma-longs that can step outside of their love of the Apple branding and gadgets and can at least consider that other things govern the rise and fall of stocks. The greatest thing though, is that one amongst this message board's long positioned readers and posters (you) has opened the door, and done so with genuine grace, and admitted that longs 'might' be in a bit of denial. I'm grateful to you for letting me know you are actually paying some attention, and are going to be WIDE AWAKE and staying on your toes, looking for bizarre anomalies and unfounded pie-in-the-sky rhetoric. Like someone else said, no stock has ever gone permanently parabolic, and the metrics in this current day market place just DO NOT ADD UP for apple's stock to continue on it's current trajectory, iphone 5 OR NOT. It can't do it. Good luck tomorrow!
