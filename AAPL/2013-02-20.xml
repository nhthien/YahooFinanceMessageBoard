In a hearing on Tuesday, U.S. District Judge Richard Sullivan sided with counsel representing David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital on the so-called "bundling" argument, which alleges Apple broke CES rules by placing multiple issues up for shareholder vote into one proposal, reports Fortune. "Candidly I do think the likelihood of success is in favor for Greenlight on the merits," Judge Sullivan said. However, the jurist failed to reach a decision as to whether the hedge fund would be irreparably harmed by Apple's proxy proposal, a requirement for an injunction against a shareholders vote scheduled for Feb. 27. He added that even if an injunction was issued, Apple still has the power to not grant the preferred stock Einhorn is fighting for. According to the publication, Judge Sullivan appeared to lean toward a "wait-and-see" scenario set forth by Apple. "It's a mess no matter what I do," he said. Greenlight's lawsuit argues that Apple's "bundling" of three items into one proposal in its proxy statement goes against SEC rules. In particular, Einhorn takes issue with Apple's so-called "Prop 2" proxy proposal which, If passed, would remove the power to issue preferred stock from Apple's board and put it in the hands of shareholders. The hedge fund is seeking the issuance of perpetual preferred stocks, dubbed "Greenlight Opportunistic Use of Preferreds" or "GO-UPs," that would pay out higher than normal dividends and mete out some of Apple's $137 billion cash hoard. In response to the allegations, Apple claimed last week that the GO-UPs would only enhance Greenlight's financials and "do not serve the public interest." Judge Sullivan said a ruling would be reached before the scheduled shareholders meeting next Wednesday.</Msg><Username>vampire_squidd</Username><Timestamp>1361336988441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 00:09:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361337122792-6</Id><Topic><Title>Apple likely to have broken SEC rules with 'bundled' proxy proposals, judge says</Title><Username>vampire_squidd</Username><Timestamp>1361336988441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 00:09:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In response to the allegations, Apple claimed last week that the GO-UPs would only enhance Greenlight's financials and "do not serve the public interest."</Msg><Username>snelsonagain</Username><Timestamp>1361337122792</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 00:12:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361337282585-7</Id><Title>Just about every aapl competitors have 1080P resolution on phones..</Title><Msg>Shiatty aapl is dead that yo mama is crying...</Msg><Username>osulinn</Username><Timestamp>1361337282585</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 00:14:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361337533788-8</Id><Topic><Title>Cnbc breaking news--- apple building something #$%$ than a tv!!!!!

I'm in today with APR 460.00 puts at $19.85 (just 2 contracts, so $3970 investment). If the trend holds, they'll be worth $60+ in a month ($12000), and around $85+ at their expiration on April 19 ($17000). Definitely a possibility of a return to 475 over the next couple days as it approaches the upper trend resistance line, but if resistance holds (likely), then it will retreat back to $450 by next week and continue its descent towards $400 in March.</Msg><Username>technical_opinion</Username><Timestamp>1361342056079</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 01:34:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361342328184-20</Id><Title>Treading water for the last few days.

Even in India where Samdung rules with its cheap phones and smartphones, Apple started marketing last year and grew its sales 400% (from 1 to 4% in only one year, and selling the most expensive smartphones in India, Apple sold its IPHONE5 in India for $850, or $200 more than it charges in USA). Even if Apple's growth rate halves in India to 200% per year, it will still get about 15% of the Indian Market by 2015... and the most profitable higher cost part. Which is why with only 20% or the worldwide smartphone market, Apple makes 70% of the worldwide profits from such.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1361359148090</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 06:19:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361359343130-73</Id><Topic><Title>Phone 5 tops world smartphone sales for Q4 2012.</Title><Username>europe_and_usa</Username><Timestamp>1361358952441</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 06:15:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I personally believe Apple needs to make a larger screen version of its iPHONE5 as an "option", so Samsung won't be able to bite off a market segment just on size/packaging.

Foxconn is China's largest private sector employer. There are all kinds of reasons this could be happening. Some possibilities: Apple might be gearing up to build a new version of the iPhone. They have already been plenty of leaks about hte iPhone 5S. Apple could be switching manufacturers. Apple could be screwed, dealing with a saturated smartphone market.</Msg><Username>getintoh20</Username><Timestamp>1361361542676</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 06:59:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361361605020-107</Id><Topic><Title>Here is why Apple sucs</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1361319368301</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-19 19:16:08 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah, and MS patches it in a day or two.

FORTUNE -- Drilling a little deeper into sales data than the larger tech research firms, Strategy Analytics on Wednesday released the chart at right, which breaks smartphone sales down by model number. The data show that Apple's (AAPL) iPhone 5 overtook Samsung's Galaxy S3 by some 12 million units in the last quarter of 2012 to become the world's bestselling smartphone. That's not terribly surprising. What is surprising is that according to Strategy Analytics the iPhone 4S -- discounted by Apple when the new model came out -- also overtook the Galaxy S3. Meanwhile, in other Apple news, the Financial Times reports that Foxconn, Apple's largest supplier, has put a hold on hiring and is cutting back on iPhone 5 production. Business Insider's Nicholas Carlson offers three possible reasons: •Apple might be gearing up to build a new version of the iPhone. They have already been plenty of leaks about the iPhone 5S. •Apple could be switching manufacturers. •Apple could be screwed, dealing with a saturated smartphone market. "Yikes. More likely Apple bad news," tweeted Henry Blodget, Carlson's boss, making it clear how he's going to spin the story</Msg><Username>getintoh20</Username><Timestamp>1361364167360</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 07:42:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361364187842-176</Id><Topic><Title>How many on this board know</Title><Username>slacytechtick</Username><Timestamp>1361363618762</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 07:33:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>bingo pure.

AAPL is so expensive that 1% up or down is translated to $4-5. So it feels like the move is huge when in reality it is not. If APPL were $45 then a 1% move would translate to 45 cents. No one would even notice. Even AAPL's 35% downturn in the last year would seem small if the company would have gone from $7 down to $4.5 or $70 to $45, instead of $700 down to $450. No doubt. AAPL is in a rough spot right now. Yet look at Nike in the last couple of years. Tanked badly and then staged a huge comeback. The AAPL brand is valuable and nothing in the long term outlook has changed. Right now it's being valued as if it's going BK - that is, zero growth, zero prospects, and no cash on hand. All investing is a risk. But this does look like a reasonable buying opportunity on valuation as AAPL finds itself between product cycles. The ASM at the end of the month will do a lot to determine which way the stock heads heading into the quaterly earnings release.</Msg><Username>groovenirvana2013</Username><Timestamp>1361365516638</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:05:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361365519237-248</Id><Title>Slingshot effect</Title><Msg>Premarket reversal might make this an up 12 pt day.

The Financial Times cited a spokesperson at Foxconn's Shenzhen facility in saying there was a hiring freeze. However, Foxconn refuted the headlines, saying that the freeze was implemented due to a higher return-rate than expected following the Chinese Lunar holiday. Foxconn said the freeze didn't have anything to do with slower iPhone 5 orders. Both reports indicate that hiring won't commence again until the end of March.</Msg><Username>getintoh20</Username><Timestamp>1361366991749</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:29:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361366993022-346</Id><Title>THe beauty of a public forum message board is ...there is NO FOOTPRINT</Title><Msg>ANyone can come, read then act.

The beginning inventory positions can vary, I mean there is just an inordinate long list of things that would make any single data point not a great proxy for what’s going on. Shame on Apple for their spokespeople failing to respond with this Cook paragraph EVERY TIME a reporter calls them for a comment. The Bloomberg article today is another example of Apple's p.r. ineptitude. It's a shame.

Note the key word is hiring, not layoffs. Each year , factory workers take several hour bus and train rides back to their villages to celebrate the holiday. When home they talk among themselves and compare notes on the working conditions and pay in their respective jobs. It is not unusual for a factory to lose up to 25% of workers, who do not return, and follow their friends to another factory. The fact that more workers returned to Foxconn, speaks highly about their working conditions and pay scale. Very, very common occurrence.</Msg><Username>levi63633</Username><Timestamp>1361368344366</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:52:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361368347467-428</Id><Title>dear pharmaheroe</Title><Msg>Please stop with your stupid posts over and over.

That was good for a 13 percent share of all smartphones shipped globally. Apple's second-tier handset, the iPhone 4S, is believed to have seen 17.4 million units shipped in the fourth quarter. That means the company's 2011 model still managed to account for an 8 percent smartphone share even after the release of the iPhone 5. According to Neil Shah, senior analyst with Strategy Analytics, the iPhone 5 and the iPhone 4S are currently the world's two most popular smartphone models. Together they took a 21 percent share of all smartphones, a total that doesn't even include the iPhone 4, which Apple continues to offer for free with a new service contract. "This was an impressive performance, given the iPhone portfolio's premium pricing," said Neil Mawston, executive director at Strategy Analytics. Coming in third behind the iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S was the Samsung Galaxy S3, of which 15.4 million units are estimated to have been shipped in the fourth quarter. That gave Samsung's flagship handset model a 7 percent share of the market. "Samsung's Galaxy S3 has long proven wildly popular with consumers and operators across North America, Europe and Asia," Mawston said. "However, global demand for the Galaxy S3 appears to have peaked and Samsung will surely be keen to introduce its rumored Galaxy S4 upgrade in the coming weeks to fight back against Apple's popular iPhone range. The fact that the iPhone 5 outsold the Galaxy S3 is no surprise, as Samsung's top tier handset launched last May — months before Apple introduced its latest handset. But the data from Strategy Analytics suggests that the launch of the iPhone 5 and subsequent price cut of the iPhone 4S to $99 on contract helped to boost sales significantly, allowing it to overtake the Galaxy S3.</Msg><Username>michalisrael157</Username><Timestamp>1361368605446</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:56:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361368643275-440</Id><Topic><Title>Foxconn: Hiring Freeze Has Nothing to Do With iPhone 5 Slowdown (AAPL)</Title><Username>getintoh20</Username><Timestamp>1361366991749</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:29:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sell now ask questions later</Msg><Username>ortigia60</Username><Timestamp>1361368643275</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:57:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361368653976-441</Id><Topic><Title>dear pharmaheroe</Title><Username>apex_trex</Username><Timestamp>1361368347467</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:52:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pharmaheroe is sheepskinner and they dont sound like idiots they are idiots.but please let them continue the feds are closing in..</Msg><Username>tolllsnameisadouche</Username><Timestamp>1361368653976</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:57:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361368655323-442</Id><Topic><Title>More bad news ????</Title><Username>paul.t.shaw</Username><Timestamp>1361368295964</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 08:51:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>iPhone 5 overtook the Galaxy?

The fact that the freeze/production slowdown at Foxconn has nothing to do with iPhone demand will be mentioned in passing, nothing more. The headline itself will continue to be promoted by the network as yet another negative bellweather for the company. In fact, the initial media release itself reeks of bad reporting and media manipulation as the article states that one of the 3 reasons the production slowdown may be occurring is poorer than anticipated iPhone demand and that Apple is "screwed". This article will provide terrific ammunition for CNBC's continuing negative onslaught on Apple...they will not let the truth dampen their version of the story!</Msg><Username>wfine</Username><Timestamp>1361369970689</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:19:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361370052064-504</Id><Topic><Title>Both Feb $500 call and put are $17.95...risk free $30 earnings play but miss the RUN!</Title><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1358755751805</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 03:09:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I posted this on Jan 21..few days before earnings..there was NOT one suggestion that was valid</Msg><Username>biglefthook_00</Username><Timestamp>1361370052064</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:20:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361370082607-505</Id><Topic><Title>Vote with Einhorn</Title><Username>btarzan</Username><Timestamp>1361369129830</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:05:29 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Whereas I agree that Einhorn's preferred share proposal is potentially a good move, I think that the decision to issue preferred shares should rest with the shareholders and not the BOD.

The Samsung S3 was the third best selling phone. This is an important data point for anyone paying close attention to the tech news lately. Samsung is out-innovating Apple, according to some in the tech press. Others in the tech press claim that Apple's is blowing it by not offering a smartphone with a bigger screen. The fact that Apple's iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 are outselling Samsung's top of the line smartphone suggests that consumers don't think Apple is getting out-innovated. Consumers also don't seem to care about the size of the screen. What people want are iPhones. What stops Apple from competing with Samsung isn't screen size or features, it's price and distribution. That's why just about every single sell-side analyst is pounding the table for Apple to release an inexpensive iPhone to compete in developing markets.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1361371125006</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:38:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361371127547-581</Id><Title>454 Needs To Hold Or Heading To 442</Title><Msg>454 is key support here.

So aapl doesn't need to source them from China for that market. AAPL also has a new assembly plant coming in Austin, Tex. LOL Tim's comments at GS on plant scheduling and errant rumor re slowing orders advised don't listen to rumors because they have no valid premise and are most always wrong and are in that case. About the i5 and Ipad lines, Foxconn scheduled overtime for the Apple assembly lines making the i5 and the ipad Mini during their Chinese NY holiday last week. Foxconn is assembling for at least 5 other smart phone makers... is it just possible that say Galaxy 3 phone orders have been slashed since those phones are no longer selling well? Then, aapl is building new plants around China and Asia -- new phones new watches new pad and what else are coming? The would all speak to not hiring more staff by itself, but aapl's competitors are losing share to aapl in smartphones and pads again... so might Foxconn's assembly for orders from other manufacturers be slowing ?

To come out with the statements he made last week when aapl was rallying. He simply killed what ever rally and now the stock has tanked in one week $30 bucks. Either he is buying aapl stock or he is the biggest moron to throw his present shareholders under the bus. Apple is too solid and has too much going on for this stock to just keep tanking. This is simply ridiculas but then again Cook has better start showing some shareholder loyalty or he will wind up in the street with a shareholder revolt.

We don't know the truth - may be AAPL is coming out with a iPhone 5 S soon. AAPL's secrecy culture make it too easy for analysts who want to bring the stock down. AAPL must counter by releasing more info to protect shareholder value. Stock is down by more than 30% and yet Cook has done absolutely nothing to stop the slide and in fact he is making it easier for negative analysts to bring it down more. Cook has the responsibility to burn these analysts by announcing a special dividend or sunstantial buyback or announcing solid plans for the future. Silence is only feeding more uncertainty and will bring stock down to 350. Cook is his worst enemy right now.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1361372332410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:58:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361372353685-679</Id><Topic><Title>Apple will be running your home IHOME!!!</Title><Username>closetlong</Username><Timestamp>1361371764531</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:49:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess you still didn't download google maps like Apple reccomended!

Apple's year-old iPhone, the iPhone 4S was the second best selling phone in the world during the fourth quarter, according to new data from research firm Strategy Analytics. The iPhone 5 was the best selling phone in the world for the quarter. The Samsung S3 was the third best selling phone. This is an important data point for anyone paying close attention to the tech news lately. Samsung is out-innovating Apple, according to some in the tech press. Others in the tech press claim that Apple's is blowing it by not offering a smartphone with a bigger screen. The fact that Apple's iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 are outselling Samsung's top of the line smartphone suggests that consumers don't think Apple is getting out-innovated. Consumers also don't seem to care about the size of the screen. What people want are iPhones. What stops Apple from competing with Samsung isn't screen size or features, it's price and distribution. That's why just about every single sell-side analyst is pounding the table for Apple to release an inexpensive iPhone to compete in developing markets.</Msg><Username>rjmcbear</Username><Timestamp>1361372693178</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:04:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361372713123-697</Id><Title>Pumpers Said 520 By Friday..</Title><Msg>Not looking so good.</Msg><Username>calls_them_as_i_see_them</Username><Timestamp>1361372713123</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:05:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361372713964-698</Id><Title>CNBC "informercial" is immune from decimating false news!!</Title><Msg>SEC punishes individuels and Companies for stock manipulation and somehow CNBC is free to bash and spread gossip all day long.

The beginning inventory positions can vary, I mean there is just an inordinate long list of things that would make any single data point not a great proxy for what’s going on.</Msg><Username>financefrau</Username><Timestamp>1361372861747</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:07:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361372874318-721</Id><Topic><Title>Truth CNBC "infomercial program" doesn't want you to know:</Title><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1360012613942</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-04 16:16:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>than why is it dropping like a rock?</Msg><Username>rosess12</Username><Timestamp>1361372874318</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:07:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361372879719-722</Id><Title>COOK IS A JOKE, AAPL HAS BECOME A JOKE</Title><Msg>PR DEPARTMENT NEEDS STONING</Msg><Username>stevegrossostinks</Username><Timestamp>1361372879719</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:07:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361372879994-723</Id><Title>AAPPLE 400 COMING FAST-CAN BIG GUYS DUMP ANY FASTER</Title><Msg>EXITS SELLING</Msg><Username>theworldview</Username><Timestamp>1361372879994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:07:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361372886009-724</Id><Title>dead cat bounce is over?</Title><Msg>I think so</Msg><Username>jeffjwang</Username><Timestamp>1361372886009</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:08:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361372890586-725</Id><Title>How do you ignore ... anyone fgure that out? eom</Title><Msg>eom</Msg><Username>hoodsternj</Username><Timestamp>1361372890586</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:08:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361372891819-726</Id><Title>SOMEONE HELP!!!

Close your computer and go get a coffee and then head over to the local golf club and relax. The value for apple is their, so overtime, this company is going to succeed and excel, end of story. P/E of 9, revenue grows every year, same with earnings per share, they have a dividend, and they have a durable competitive advangtage, and they have 137 B in the bank. If thats not a company with value, i don't know what is. You have to forget about the past and how apple shot from the 350 t0 700 dollar range like it did and has fast as it did. The market is and always has been shortsighted (atleast it has for my 19 yrs on this earth). Buy anywhere between 349.99 and 525 and over TIME, you will be just fine. Value is the one thing in the stock market that although may encounter bumps and bruises here and there; it will always perservere and strive to the top in the end.

If Apple is forced to return their mountain of money to investors, it may give the share price a temporary boost, but in the long run this will severely hamstring Apple competitively and could send them down the road to irrelevance.

It's been going on for years and Erin Burnett was also good for it before she went to CNN. Melissa Lee, Cramer, Squak Box, Closing Bell...the voices/show changes but the message remains the same - BASH Apple! It's been a concerted, ongoing smear campaign where the talking heads are obviously ordered to perpetuate the negative spin. About 2 weeks ago, Melissa Lee had an Apple bull on. She mistakenly referred to Apple reaching a recent price of $419/share and her slanted negativity prompted the positive analyst to call her out and say that she obviously has an axe to grind with the company...she defended herself by saying that she was simply playing devil's advocate. It was refreshing to see her blatant bias being pointed out on air. Once you're able to watch CNBC with detached objectivity and see them for what they really are (media manipulators fulfilling the corporate agenda of Comcast), it becomes the comedy channel with reference to how they report on Apple and their "journalistic integrity" should be taken with a Gibraltar sized grain of salt.</Msg><Username>wfine</Username><Timestamp>1361375200081</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:46:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361375232378-946</Id><Title>UNDER COOK, STOCK WENT FROM 700 TO 450.

Instead, Cook noted how Apple has actively been acquiring smaller companies that it finds as a better fit. "If you look at the past three years," Cook said, "we've averaged about an acquisition every other month. They're companies where they have really smart people and/or IP. Generally speaking, we've been in many cases taking something they're working on and move the skills to work on something else." Cook went on to cite the example of Apple's acquisition of PA Semiconductor. "This was an incredibly skilled group of guys, and they could supplement an incredible group of folks and they were working on PowerPC at the time. We didn't have an interest in that, so we moved the skills to work on our iPhone and other engines. We will do more of those." As to large companies, Cook said the company's patient and deliberate approach to acquisitions typically precluded such purchases, despite Apple's cash holdings in excess of $125 billion. "We have looked at large companies. In each case, it didn't pass our test. Will we look at more? I think so. But we're disciplined and thoughtful, and we don't feel a pressure to go out and acquire revenue. We want to make great products. If a large company could help us, then that would be of interest. But, again: Deliberate, thoughtful is our mantra."

According to Liu, Foxconn saw more workers returning after the Chinese New Year break than it was expecting, and so it needed to lose some staff. In China, workers typically decide to switch jobs right after the New Year break, so employers prepare themselves for staff shortages when people don’t turn up for work. But Foxconn saw more workers returning this year than it did a year ago. And a month-long freeze could have a big impact on Foxconn’s headcount. According to the FT, the average worker tenure at the company is less than 13 months, which means it could lose tens of thousands of staff in just that short space of time.</Msg><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1361375526216</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:52:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361375541506-976</Id><Topic><Title>HEADLINE HEADLINE APPLE CUTS IPHONE5 PARTS BY HALF</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1359492823173</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 15:53:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>samsung winning</Msg><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1361375541506</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:52:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361375564857-977</Id><Topic><Title>Hit a Major Home run on Joy ... thanks AEA and Davidch14</Title><Username>lorde_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1361374615112</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:36:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>today has been a lot of laffs... lucky there is more to come...lol</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1361375564857</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:52:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361375573028-978</Id><Topic><Title>Better hope that Einhorn doesn't get his way...</Title><Username>odor_of_magnitude</Username><Timestamp>1361375109942</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:45:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They are squandering the cash at 1% annual ROR.

Melissa missed that "small" story. Article attached.</Title><Msg>Apple's year-old iPhone, the iPhone 4S was the second best selling phone in the world during the fourth quarter, according to new data from research firm Strategy Analytics. The iPhone 5 was the best selling phone in the world for the quarter. The Samsung S3 was the third best selling phone. This is an important data point for anyone paying close attention to the tech news lately. Samsung is out-innovating Apple, according to some in the tech press. Others in the tech press claim that Apple's is blowing it by not offering a smartphone with a bigger screen. The fact that Apple's iPhone 4S and iPhone 5 are outselling Samsung's top of the line smartphone suggests that consumers don't think Apple is getting out-innovated. Consumers also don't seem to care about the size of the screen. What people want are iPhones. What stops Apple from competing with Samsung isn't screen size or features, it's price and distribution. That's why just about every single sell-side analyst is pounding the table for Apple to release an inexpensive iPhone to compete in developing markets.</Msg><Username>buylow40</Username><Timestamp>1361375796697</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:56:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361375797834-1001</Id><Topic><Title>I think Apple is on a contrarian mode</Title><Username>adavidson_nyc</Username><Timestamp>1361375692151</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:54:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>down $25 over 6 sessions doesn't qualify as sideways.

But lately prodcut releases have not been that impressive and AAPL is no longer a generation ahead of competition (in some cases AAPL is trying to catch up), so secrecy is doing more harm than good. AAPL needs to be more forthcoming in their future plans so investors can judge for themselves if AAPL is worth holding without manipulative headlines caused by analysts who are trying to bring the stock down.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1361378337838</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:38:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361378349982-1217</Id><Title>Apple is about to bust open wide and fly like an frozen cow terd!</Title><Msg>BWAHAHAHA!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>blackmonday1987</Username><Timestamp>1361378349982</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:39:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361378380522-1218</Id><Topic><Title>Cook doing a terrible job in managing company - we need a fix NOW</Title><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1361372332410</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:58:52 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>#$%$.

For now we maintain our iPhone shipment estimate of 37.5M and revenues/EPS estimate of $42.7B/$10.04 (St $43.0B/$10.26; guidance $41-$43B), but could be at risk." The firm maintains a Hold rating and $500 price target on AAPL. On BlackBerry, Misek said initial Z10 sales have not been as bad as many feared and recent launches in France, Saudi Arabia, UAE, and Kuwait have gone well. In the UK 20%+ of Carphone Warehouse phones are out of stock based on Tuesday night checks. "We raise Feb Q estimates from $2.5B/$(0.42) to $2.8B/$(0.34) after including 500K BB10 shipments but remain slightly below St $2.9B/$(0.33). We note consensus estimates have decreased over the last six weeks. We remain well above St for the May Q and Aug Q (we estimate 4M BB10 sales at a $600 ASP and 30% GM in each quarter) but reiterate that it is not just about the phone. We continue to see software opportunities in mobile device management and BYOD to drive value." The firm maintained a Buy rating and price target of $19.50 on BBRY.</Msg><Username>getintoh20</Username><Timestamp>1361381403880</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:30:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361381405737-1436</Id><Title>CFO / Cook has to take some action or this will not stop.</Title><Msg>This is not an ordinary situation, and it calls for drastic measures from mgmt.

There is no truth to your assertion that Apple is being "taken to the cleaners." Actually, this news is, most likely, VERY ***positive.""" It seems to me that the production of the iPhone5, a phone that is very difficult to build, has finally been streamlined. This will help margins tremendously. The only ***Facts*** we have state that Apple beat Samsung pretty handily in the last quarter and that was WITH production issues on the 5, 4S and 4. Those FACTS tell me that all is well at Apple. You can twist reality anyway you want it, but that doesn't make it true. The facts we have all point to a streamlined production line and excellent sales. Couple that with Chinese New Year and we're looking at another 11-12 billion dollars in the Apple vault.</Msg><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1361381472861</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:31:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361381483766-1440</Id><Topic><Title>CFO / Cook has to take some action or this will not stop.</Title><Username>ajmckay1000</Username><Timestamp>1361381405737</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:30:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not a chance. if they gave a #$%$ about shareholders, they would have done something long befor now.</Msg><Username>heybarrywheresmyfreestuff</Username><Timestamp>1361381483766</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:31:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361381512801-1441</Id><Topic><Title>the true is lucky aapl can hold 450 today</Title><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361377862190</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 11:31:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lolol</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1361381512801</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:31:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361381514732-1442</Id><Topic><Title>JOY up 6%</Title><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361375333927</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 10:48:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361381514732</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:31:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361381529817-1443</Id><Title>Any chance of an emergency BOD meeting?</Title><Msg>To fire Cook?</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1361381529817</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:32:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361381541080-1444</Id><Topic><Title>down 10 today?</Title><Username>heybarrywheresmyfreestuff</Username><Timestamp>1361370909036</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 09:35:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>nice call;)</Msg><Username>heybarrywheresmyfreestuff</Username><Timestamp>1361381541080</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:32:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361381549450-1445</Id><Topic><Title>HEADLINE HEADLINE FOXCONN FREEZING EXPANSION PLANS AT MAIN IPHONE PLANT.NIKKEI REPORT</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1361380020808</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:07:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Maybe they are moving their new product assembly out of China.</Msg><Username>retire_yung</Username><Timestamp>1361381549450</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:32:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361381602276-1446</Id><Title>Yikes Longs,Don't You Get It Yet ??</Title><Msg>The stock is in a solid technical downtrend.

A report in the Financial Times blamed the move on slowing production of the Apple iPhone 5. But Bloomberg reports that Foxconn is saying the move is not related to Apple, and instead reflects the fact that more employees returned from the Chinese New Year break than a year earlier. UBS analyst Steve Milunovich points out in a research note this morning that while he and others picked up on an Apple production decline at Asian suppliers in December, “sources indicate there has not been a change since.” His theory is that the weakness could actually be related to Hewlett-Packard, which he estimates accounts for 8%-10% of Foxconn’s revenue. “We believe that Foxconn makes mostly desktop PCs for HP along with some printers and servers,” Milunovich asserts. “We are forecasting a 12% [year-over-year] PC revenue decline for HP in the quarter to be announced tomorrow. Yesterday, Dell indicated that PC demand and pricing remain difficult. In addition, we are concerned about printer demand and that the declines in printer hardware shipments will begin to affect supplies revenue over the next few quarters.”</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1361383318336</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:01:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361383338095-1532</Id><Topic><Title>HEADLINE HEADLINE SHARP CUTS IPAD SCREEN AS DEMAND DROPS</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1359493018542</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 15:56:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>pan boy, I hope you die a slow agonizing death and rot in satans basement.

Or at least, I wouldn't use the word in the same context. We've actually spent billions in the supply chain. We've spent billions on acquisitions and including the acquisition of IP. We've spent billions on retail. We've spent billions on the infrastructure, the company, data centers and so forth for the App Store and iCloud, etc., but yes we still have a lot. I guess I'm just pointing that out to say--I would say that we're judicious; we're deliberate. We spend our money like it's our last penny. I think shareholders want us to do that. They don't want us to act like we're rich, and we've never felt that way honestly. That may sound bizarre, but it's the truth. Now, in terms of our approach on cash, I've said since becoming CEO, I'm not religious about this. I'm not religious about holding it or not holding it. And we're in very active discussions at the board level on what we should do. But I think everyone would want us to be deliberate and really think through, and that's what we're doing. We're not going to go have a toga party or do something outlandish, and so people don't have to worry it's going to burn a hole in our pocket. It was always discussed. It's not new that we're discussing it. It is being discussed more, now, and in greater detail, and that's because the balance has risen to the point that you've already made. And I think it's clear to everyone, and I'd be the first to admit, we have more cash than we need to run the business on a daily basis. I'm sure everyone would agree with that in here. And so we're actively discussing it. I only ask for a bit of patience, so that we can do this in a very deliberate way and make the best decision for the shareholders.</Msg><Username>airportsedan</Username><Timestamp>1361383494452</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:04:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361383521120-1541</Id><Topic><Title>HEADLINE HEADLINE FOXCONN FREEZING EXPANSION PLANS AT MAIN IPHONE PLANT.NIKKEI REPORT</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1361380020808</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:07:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Foxconn Says Hiring Freeze Not Apple Related; Blame HP</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1361383521120</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:05:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361383529335-1542</Id><Title>Iphone is so YESTERDAY....</Title><Msg>Where's my IWatch?</Msg><Username>samsonp65</Username><Timestamp>1361383529335</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:05:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361383547729-1543</Id><Title>DK calling for 1420-1440-area...</Title><Msg>thinks things are overpriced here</Msg><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1361383547729</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:05:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361383595293-1544</Id><Topic><Title>Yikes Longs,Don't You Get It Yet ??</Title><Username>crestrider7</Username><Timestamp>1361381602276</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 12:33:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No the only thing going on here is that the media is not done bashing apple.

We think HP represents 8-10% of Foxconn’s revenue. We believe that Foxconn makes mostly desktop PCs for HP along with some printers and servers. We are forecasting a 12% YoY PC revenue decline for HP in the quarter to be announced tomorrow. Yesterday Dell indicated that PC demand and pricing remain difficult. In addition, we are concerned about printer demand and that the declines in printer hardware shipments will begin to affect supplies revenue over the next few quarters.

Please for those who say they need the cash for stradegic reasons,that is insulting. They spent 10 Billion last year on capex and another 10 billion on a divi and another 2-3 billion on buybacks and still stuffed 10 billion in U.S. instruments alone.

Recruitment of Foxconn Zhengzhou factory has a full cessation of recruitment As for when recovery is temporarily not clear now, our leadership is closely Foxconn communication messages will promptly announced. Henan employment center staff yesterday on the "First Financial Daily" said. 　　This reporter learned that, with the exception of the Henan factory Foxconn to other parts of the plant also suspend recruiting general workers received before and after the Spring Festival. "The Shenzhen factory did suspend the recruitment." Foxconn mainland spokesman told reporters, the ninth day factory just work, more details are not clear. 　　Insiders pointed out that the The employment contraction on the one hand in order to better adjust the production line, the other hand, in artificial intelligent production line reallocate do adequate preparation. 　　Recruitment freeze 　　Our reporter yesterday called at the Shenzhen Foxconn Technology Group at the total human resources cadre recruitment, said the plant has the recruitment freeze, and in some places on the recruitment website Foxconn recruitment notification No telephone message. 　　Henan Foxconn online recruitment center "on the site, the reporter saw the latest recruitment" display "Foxconn recruitment of a full cessation, six months is not hiring" the words, and before January 22, the site made a Emergency Notification, the notification display in Zhengzhou the Foxconn, Jiyuan Foxconn, the factory production line adjustments, employment plans significantly reduce Tingzhao Zhengzhou factory in December 2012, June 2013, is no longer large-scale recruitment. 　　The above employment center in Henan Province, told reporters that, in November last year, the plant is still recruiting, but began in December last year, the recruitment of the Foxconn plant in the region has stopped, has been going on for three months. The reasons for the hiring freeze, the source said may and iPhone5 cut there is a certain relationship. 　　The same situation occurs in Shenzhen and other places. 　　"In the past this time period, number of queued candidates like to the train station to buy a ticket like but do not know how it happened, and the recruitment point the window off." Also told reporters reflect a Foxconn factory near people. 　　Reporter learned that, last year, is only the beginning of seven day, the Fuji Kang Longhua factory on the recruitment of 5,000 people, the number of large-scale recruitment before the Lantern Festival of up to 3 million people.

"Foxconn should also belong to the individual phenomenon." 　　This reporter learned that, if Foxconn employment needs of various subsidiaries, subject to the approval of the Group's senior. However, from now on the situation, even if reported, by the high-level approval is highly unlikely. According to media reports, the Fuji Kang Longhua plant gradually transformed into a high-tech research and development center, has been more than a month not to recruit people for years after years ago the general workers demand reduction in the number has been estimated. 　　Referrals referral fee into the plant last year when the highest up to 1,500 yuan, but then the penny did not.

"At a the Shenzhen Foxconn employees Gala, Gou said Foxconn production line robots will increase quantity, in order to complete the simple repetition of the work, instead of workers. 　　It is understood that in addition to the Luoyang area, Foxconn robot project in Jincheng offline. The Shanxi Jincheng Foxconn Terry Gou said earlier, in 2016, the production base for intelligent robot output value exceeded 500 billion yuan. "To see the first batch of fully automated factory in 5-10 years, and in a few years through automation to eliminate repetitive and easy process." Gou said. 　　Social Sciences, Guangdong Province, Development Research Center Director Li Youhuan, told reporters that the use of robots is a new model for the operation and management of Foxconn, are also likely to have an enormous impact on the future development, in particular, to improve productivity and reduce labor costs aspects. "Use robots work in accordance with a pre-set program, complete autonomy provisions of actions or operations to improve production efficiency, reduce costs and increase profits.

CBN Daily, in a story picked up by other Chinese media, quoted insiders as saying that the recruitment freeze is being done to adjust the production line and prepare for "artificial intelligence production." Reports since late last year have said that Foxconn has been gradually installing robots on its production lines in Zhengzhou and Shenzhen to improve production of Apple and other devices. Foxconn also has announced plans to install 10,000 robots on its factory lines that could replace up to 1 million workers over several years. The Zhengzhou plant reportedly accounts for 70% of iPhone shipments. There also was a strike at Zhengzhou in October by workers protesting the stricter quality-control standards for iPhone 5.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1361386825904</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:00:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361386843209-1690</Id><Topic><Title>Down but very low volume</Title><Username>roop2000</Username><Timestamp>1361386772778</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 13:59:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>huh?

Check out the ACWI chart. I hope the market goes a bit higher in the short term because it is going to setup such a monstrous crash. It will be one for the books. I would encourage you to start buying protection to hedge your portfolio. You may short TNA, buy FAZ, buy SKF, buy SPXS, buy TZA, buy VXX, etc. There are many other moves that you can make as well. Also, I would not necessarily buy GLD or AGQ at this point. Let these come down lower. Once they do, you can pounce on buying these as well. Good luck to all.</Msg><Username>coolstarsky</Username><Timestamp>1361388545075</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:29:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361388548099-1790</Id><Title>"ITS OVER JOHNNY!!!!!!!!"</Title><Msg>THE LATE GREAT : COLONEL SAMULA TRAUTMAN</Msg><Username>stevegrossostinks</Username><Timestamp>1361388548099</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:29:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361388565937-1791</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★★CNBC STILL shoving "SUNSHINE" up my ACE...Bwhahahahaha!</Title><Username>zip_i_t_do_da</Username><Timestamp>1360872216989</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-14 15:03:36 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hhjhjhj</Msg><Username>wallysworld18</Username><Timestamp>1361388565937</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:29:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361388566167-1792</Id><Topic><Title>you guys are way way way over thinking this</Title><Username>i_came_to_shred</Username><Timestamp>1361387947368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:19:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>LOL....SAME THING YOU SAID AT $650 SCOOTER!!!

For the first time, Apple has given a range for expected revenue - $41bn to $43bn, that is 5-10% up on the $39.2bn for Q2 2012. Although it expects a gross margin of 37.5 - 38.5%, unlike in previous quarters no guidance was given for EPS. Until recently, Intel (INTC) updated guidance mid quarter, so Apple may try that to reduce volatility in the share price and increase transparency. The likely timing for any revenue guidance upgrade is before the end of February and after the end of Chinese New Year. This started on Feb. 10, is a seven-day holiday in Mainland China and the main gift giving season as many receive bonuses and many migrants to the cities return home. So where will the increased revenue come from? Apple entered the quarter with unmet demand for the iPhone 4, iPad mini and iMacs and having had record sales in FY Q1 for iPhones, iPads, iTunes and Accessories (four out of the six product categories).</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1361389798329</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:49:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361389824343-1870</Id><Topic><Title>you guys are way way way over thinking this</Title><Username>i_came_to_shred</Username><Timestamp>1361387947368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:19:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sell it end of April 2016, if you really want to enjoy your investment.</Msg><Username>todd0888</Username><Timestamp>1361389824343</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:50:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361389871261-1871</Id><Topic><Title>you guys are way way way over thinking this</Title><Username>i_came_to_shred</Username><Timestamp>1361387947368</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:19:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>works too</Msg><Username>i_came_to_shred</Username><Timestamp>1361389871261</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:51:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361389896780-1872</Id><Title>AAPL's big gap up tomorrow</Title><Msg>Opens over 460.</Msg><Username>truetrader100</Username><Timestamp>1361389896780</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:51:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361389906041-1873</Id><Title>Samdung up 50% since 2010</Title><Msg>Wish I was Korean.</Msg><Username>tukkersmom2</Username><Timestamp>1361389906041</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:51:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361389911649-1874</Id><Topic><Title>HEADLNE HEADLINE BIG BIG DAY FOR SAMSUNG ON MARCH 14 2013 IN NEWYORK SAMSUNG WILL INVEIL THE SAMSUNG GALAXY S4 FOR THE WORLD TO SEE</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1361219611615</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-18 15:33:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This coul hurt apple earning in q2 and 2013,the new reliease of samsung galaxy s4 in spring q2 2013</Msg><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1361389911649</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 14:51:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361389931002-1875</Id><Title>I like how it is trading in thtat down sweep.

Starting in 2001 Apple has updated its devices (iPhones, iPads, and iPods (except for 2011)) annually. People have become accustomed to this, but Apple is planning to wait a while on the iPhone 6. In 2012 Apple derived 53% of its revenue from iPhones. With the stock recently dropping from around $700/share to currently float around $460-$470/share, many people have concerns for the company. Apple fans should not be worried about the company's new releases--there will be plenty in 2013. Although there is a lot of speculation, Apple could be releasing the new iPhone 5S or a low-cost iPhone in the summer, along with a new iPad 5, iPad Mini 2, and maybe even an iTV in the fall months. The iPhone 6 isn't expected until the summer of 2014. As for shareholders, there shouldn't be much concern. With earnings per share increasing the past five years to the tune of 823%, and revenues increasing 507% in the same time frame, the company appears to be rising. Apple's largest fear should be the expectations others put on them. The company just had its best quarter and yet many people were disappointed with the results. The company shows a P/E of 10.62 and a market cap of nearly half a trillion dollars.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1361391438503</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:17:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361391476960-1990</Id><Title>ALL AAPL SHORTS JUST FILTHY RICH!!!!!!!!!............BWHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHAH</Title><Msg>Just rich beyond belief!!!.......im making over 100 grand a week on this garbage!!! bwhhahaha</Msg><Username>sheepskinner7</Username><Timestamp>1361391476960</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:17:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361391520877-1991</Id><Topic><Title>WHY GOLD AND SILVER KEEEP GOING DOWN???</Title><Username>mlg4044</Username><Timestamp>1361390873242</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:07:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GLD is getting very close to being a buy.

Reinvigorating the cool factor would be to have Jony Ives walking on stage at the opening of the presentation to fill the shoes of Steve Jobs. I think Tim Cook is getting the short end of the stick due to the impatience set in by these analyst hammering away at the negatives. Eg, Apple never publicized any info of an iTV, but for the last year plus we have blind speculation coming from the unknowing D-bags, also know as Analysts. Apple is moving to their own beat and for perfection to be achieved the last thing Apple needs is the worthless media to disseminate bad information such as this morning when CNBC enthusiastically deduced the hire freeze at Foxconn was due to lack of demand on Apple products, when, if they even put forth the minimal effort to do there job ethically, the reason was due to HPQs lack of demand. One statement that Tim C made on the conference call was to disregard all the "NOISE". Lets come to a hard fact ppl, the last quarter earning was, "THE BEST IN TECH HISTORY", and all the fundamentals are still intact. Lets show a li'l patience on this and refrain from the obvious BS speculation that the media seems to embrace. One thing we can clearly understand is that any dignity that once prevailed in journalism has vanished, without of trace.</Msg><Username>jlag69</Username><Timestamp>1361393414149</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:50:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361393434580-2090</Id><Title>Used to be</Title><Msg>There was a short covering spike last 10 minutes of day Now they don't bother</Msg><Username>i5unknown</Username><Timestamp>1361393434580</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:50:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361393441387-2091</Id><Topic><Title>wait to buy ah 447</Title><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361393084820</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:44:44 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ggggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_fyi1</Username><Timestamp>1361393441387</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:50:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361393461981-2092</Id><Topic><Title>Nothing but a money pit at this point!</Title><Username>genetaranto</Username><Timestamp>1361393218699</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 15:46:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Cook doesn't care for shareholders otherwise I will not be down 10K in last 2 weeks .

There is no underlying deterioration in fundamentals, so market will not decline. Market has not reached the peak yet - when market goes up big 2-3 days in a row with heavy volume, then it's a peak. However, that has not happened yet - market has been going up very sluggishly which is not a sign of peaking out. Another sign - there is no euphoria - on the other hand many people talking about correction and that's precisely the reason market wouldn't go down. I am buying on dip such as BAC, CRUS, CE, C, and AAPL.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1361394517759</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:08:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361394522483-2160</Id><Topic><Title>JUEW hunting time - one of you pieces of #$%$ will be beaten to death tonight</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1361394313844</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:05:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and you sleeze ball Adam L children will be first.

Apple stock suffered greatly toward the end of last year. The sharp drop in price dealt a severe blow to investor confidence in the stock. However, the company has been consistent in its knack for innovation and pleasant surprises. The iPhone and iPad, which generate 60% of the company's revenue, are still maintaining double-digit growth. After adjustments, compared to this time last year, iPhone and iPad units are up 35% and 62% respectively. Although the playing field has gotten more competitive, Apple is still performing well and has momentum. Apple still carries a lot of potential to perform well this year, and I remain confident in the company. This company is reasonably priced for both value and growth paradigms.

But it costs $375 to make the 32GB version of the new iPad, around half the retail price. As a result, consumers are paying a bigger premium on iPhones than the iPad, says technology consultant Jeff Kagan. “Is the iPhone expensive? Yes,” Kagan says. “It is overpriced? Yes.” Consumers think they pay a cheaper price for iPhones as wireless carriers absorb two-thirds of the original retail price, he says. However, customers who keep their iPhone and renew their contract after the initial two-year contract expires are paying a premium for using an old phone, he says.</Msg><Username>waldo.ferris</Username><Timestamp>1361395143507</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:19:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361395155770-2213</Id><Topic><Title>Coming for your children now you juewwpigs</Title><Username>tamermou</Username><Timestamp>1361394897830</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 16:14:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh comeon Tamermou.

The proposal would require the company to seek shareholder approval for issuing any preferred stock, similar to the type that Greenlight’s David Einhorn has been seeking from the company. See WSJ story: Greenlight urges judge to block vote on Apple proposal. Apple’s annual shareholder meeting is set for next Wednesday, Feb. 27, at the company’s headquarters in Cupertino, Calif.

CBN Daily, in a story picked up by other Chinese media, quoted insiders as saying that the recruitment freeze is being done to adjust the production line and prepare for "artificial intelligence production." Reports since late last year have said that Foxconn has been gradually installing robots on its production lines in Zhengzhou and Shenzhen to improve production of Apple and other devices. Foxconn also has announced plans to install 10,000 robots on its factory lines that could replace up to 1 million workers over several years. The Zhengzhou plant reportedly accounts for 70% of iPhone shipments.

Why on God's green Earth would you expect him to come out and "say something" to stop that??? As an Apple long, I'm loving the dip, as I know that the buyback is going to net them a ton more shares and increase the company's overall value, in the long term. Listen, Apple stays the course. They don't react and to and defend the stock price. Steve Jobs would be doing the EXACT SAME THING Then, when the time was right, he would come out and announce the newest and greatest product. And that's what Tim Cook will do, too. Christ, just give it time. Apple is set to inevitably release iTV, iRadio, iWatch and refreshed Macs, iPhones and iPads. But they're certainly not going to, nor should they, rush those to market or tell us about them, just to prop up the slumping share price. If you don't like the way the company is run ... SELL YOUR SHARES.</Msg><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1361402295284</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:18:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361402320242-2442</Id><Title>Will Google Buy Apple...</Title><Msg>after it crashes to under $100/sh?

Your argument is invalid. Period. . The iPhone 5 and iPhone 4S were the two best-selling smartphones in the fourth quarter of 2012, according to a new Strategy Analytics report. Strategy Analytics’ data showed the iPhone 5 was the overall champ, with 27.4 million iPhone 5 units sold in the fourth quarter, while 17.4 million 4S units were sold, and 15.4 million Galaxy S III units were sold. The iPhone 5 and 4S combined accounted for 1 in 5 of smartphones shipped in the world in Q4 2012. “The iPhone 5 captured an impressive 13 percent share of all smartphones shipped globally, and it has become the world’s bestselling smartphone model for the first time ever,” Strategy Analytics wrote in its report. “A rich touchscreen design, extensive distribution across dozens of countries, and generous operator subsidies have been among the main causes of the iPhone 5’s success.”</Msg><Username>scropos21</Username><Timestamp>1361402441886</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:20:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361402445295-2449</Id><Title>Foxconn statement that apple is retooling for newer product</Title><Msg>Foxconn tonite made a statement the apple is retooling for another serious market new product, spring launch,</Msg><Username>sliknoil</Username><Timestamp>1361402445295</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 18:20:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361402472223-2450</Id><Title>JP Morgan analysts' target for Apple is 350-370.

So now FoxConn workers can only be made to work 60 hours per week max. instead of 72 hours without overtime. Also their pay has been increased greatly from $1 an hour in 2011 to $2 an hour now. Most of Obama's folks on welfare in USA may laugh at $2 an hour pay, but that's alot 4X what most of China's 650 million Peasant Farmers make per year. Its great pay $2 an hour there, so alot more FoxConn workers, this year 90% chose to return to their jobs after Chinese New Years Week. Hence less new hiring is needed now. It had nothing to do with IPHONE5 production or sales.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1361407805593</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 19:50:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361407807319-2633</Id><Topic><Title>Closed out AAPL AH at highs +2...</Title><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1353459672105</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-11-20 20:01:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Did the same thing.

First we are looking at a weak April quarter where revenue and earnings will probably be flat to slightly lower than last years according the projections fo the CFO Oppenheimer during last earning report. Secondly, we might be in for a correction in the broader markets and if so, AAPL will probably follow the market down.

Management has already told us that April will be weak. We could see the trailing pe drop from 44 to something like 42 or less. We are also entering weakness in the broader market with serous political and financial decisions facing a divided Congress and nation. It wouldn't surprise me if Apple follows the market down in a broader correction. We are at a trailing PE of something like 10.15. If the Trailing Earning fall below 44 PE, then we will see that pe jump higher at the earnings and institutions are fully aware of this problem.</Msg><Username>billyhjohnrousseau</Username><Timestamp>1361408665707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 20:04:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361408762001-2658</Id><Topic><Title>iPhone 5 #1, 4s #2 Read below, FACT!!</Title><Username>jetson.george39</Username><Timestamp>1361406750599</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 19:32:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Another important questions: Is the present correction and price already baking in a bad April quarter?</Msg><Username>billyhjohnrousseau</Username><Timestamp>1361408762001</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 20:06:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361408999081-2659</Id><Topic><Title>i think more retail is starting to short</Title><Username>dorianpc</Username><Timestamp>1361408639523</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 20:03:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you have no position.

So much AAPL could outside of hardware that they seem oblivious to, or unaware. Software, media content, search, the list goes on. Emerging markets are ripe, however AAPL needs to seriously deploy a large portion of their cash hoard towards these efforts. Time is a function of money. Investing it in bonds is not the answer.

And as I mentioned previously, I was anticipating GOOG to pull back at least over the next 5 days. As I mentioned earlier today, GOOG's movement today fell perfectly into my calculated range and I anticipate it hitting my buy target for tomorrow. That being said, I'm questioning whether or not I will pull the trigger tomorrow to add to my position if the target is hit for two reasons: 1) I am leaning towards the market continuing its pullback for a couple/few more days with GOOG following along, and 2) I already have a sizable position at 705. Not sure at the moment how I plan to react tomorrow if my target is hit. I have two target sets I prepared... the first set being which GOOG is currently on track, the second set for intensifies pressure due to overall market conditions.

If we don't take action to alleviate this practice it will continue.</Msg><Username>randylee442000</Username><Timestamp>1361418439820</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 22:47:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1361418510004-2808</Id><Title>Subject</Title><Msg>Type message</Msg><Username>randylee442000</Username><Timestamp>1361418510004</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 22:48:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361418553505-2809</Id><Topic><Title>This is the worst!...</Title><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1361410239153</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 20:30:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Lorde Chatterly would think it was this Tony character whoever he is.</Msg><Username>snelsonagain</Username><Timestamp>1361418553505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 22:49:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361418594113-2810</Id><Topic><Title>Oh, and yes, we are getting our Temple at One World Trade Center...Shukran</Title><Username>darlaleen</Username><Timestamp>1361411260234</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 20:47:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sorry Bigleftfoot hacked into my account and has been posting under my ID.</Msg><Username>darlaleen</Username><Timestamp>1361418594113</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 22:49:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1361418904319-2811</Id><Topic><Title>This is the worst!...</Title><Username>funniebucket</Username><Timestamp>1361410239153</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-20 20:30:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Snels, it is Tony, not Big Left Hook doing the immitation on Darlaleen...please let her know.

many out there who are playing with the Apple stock. First you sell at the high and start shorting it. Then you start pushing all the misleading junk to trash the stock knowing that Apple is still a very solid company. I mean come on... they have $140b in cash and 2013 sales will be the strongest. If you are going to get in, you better do it now. Once these big hedge fund managers and other shorters start buying the price will rocket back up.
