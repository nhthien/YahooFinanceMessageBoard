You save on having no brokerage fees for the Reinvestment, and over time, those 'fractional' shares add up nicely. And a Split would do nicely for you too. The lower share prices increase the fractional amount over time. I have a small holding of another stock, from many years ago, which started off with only 10 shares, and today it is over 50, due to reinvestment.

You don't have to buy stock when you buy call. Your gain on the call is only from the premium gain. You don't have to wait until expiration to sell call. You can take profit at anytime. Note that option expires on Sat, not on Friday, but the last day you can trade is Friday. If the call is in-the-money (stock price is higher than the strike price of the call) at the closing of the regular session on the expiration Friday, your broker will automatically exercise the right the call gives you and buy stock at the strike price on Sat. If you don't want to own stock for some reasons, you must tell your broker not to exercise it or sell the call before expiration. If the call is out-of-money (stock price is lower than the strike price of the call), it will be worthless after expiration. Unless you tell your broker to exercise it, your broker won't do anything and will just let it expires.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1344176890114</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 10:28:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344177055603-19</Id><Topic><Title>should i reinvest dividend?</Title><Username>acmech13</Username><Timestamp>1344118231920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 18:10:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No commission fees for divvy reinvestment. If you are truly going long term, this will be of benefit. And if the rumored Split occurs, you will be buying higher fractional shares, down the road, so it adds up even better.

Just the right size and weight for those small hands. A 7" tablet is the size that would be ideal to keep in the car. It fits in the glove compartment, and would eliminate the need for a $2000 factory-installed GPS system, as well as providing Internet access on the go. With Siri integration coming to most car manufacturers, this alone could be a multi-million unit market for the 7" size iPad.</Msg><Username>aapl_investor</Username><Timestamp>1344183384998</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:16:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344183937379-37</Id><Topic><Title>Good way to able get pay 2 x aapl dividends next week is sell/short on rally before ex-dividend date, then buy back on next day sell off</Title><Username>aea_32</Username><Timestamp>1344183641549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:20:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That's not how it works You must pay the original owner those dividends you don't get double</Msg><Username>robbierobnj</Username><Timestamp>1344183937379</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:25:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344184067898-38</Id><Topic><Title>Good way to able get pay 2 x aapl dividends next week is sell/short on rally before ex-dividend date, then buy back on next day sell off</Title><Username>aea_32</Username><Timestamp>1344183641549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:20:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I was assuming you expect the stock to drop by the dividend amount I wouldn't expect that and aapl bounces on evry dip so i would just stya long take the divi and laugh at the year end when we are close to 1k .</Msg><Username>robbierobnj</Username><Timestamp>1344184067898</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 12:27:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344184305023-39</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL in "breakout" mode above 620 early Monday August 6th</Title><Username>rndyjensen</Username><Timestamp>1344067693727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 04:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why would it dive ?

Will it dip back down into the low $600's or stay at a new base price of $620-$630?

The Shanghai Composite Index (SHCOMP) slipped 0.1 percent to 2,130.60 at 9:53 a.m. local time, erasing a gain of as much as 0.2 percent. The CSI 300 Index (SHSZ300) declined 0.1 percent to 2,350.41. The Bloomberg China-US 55 Index (CH55BN), the measure of the most-traded U.S.-listed Chinese companies, added 2 percent in New York. The securities regulator published draft rules that would allow publicly traded companies to pay as much as 30 percent of wages in stock, according to the draft posted on the China Securities Regulatory Commission’s website yesterday. Employees who receive shares as salaries or bonuses would have to hold them for at least 36 months, the CSRC said. “More listed companies and their employees will buy their own shares as stocks are pretty attractive especially in terms of dividend yields,” said Wu Kan, a Shanghai-based fund manager at Dazhong Insurance Co., which oversees $285 million. “Though the securities regulator is hammering out a spate of measures to support equities, the market focus is still on when economic growth will bottom and pick up.” The Shanghai index rose 0.2 percent last week, the first gain in seven weeks, after the securities regulator announced it will cut transaction fees by 20 percent.</Msg><Username>croatkid1</Username><Timestamp>1344220363100</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:32:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344220544829-210</Id><Topic><Title>We should open up $10 tomorrow</Title><Username>packt25</Username><Timestamp>1344219432504</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:17:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why? gimme a reason why.</Msg><Username>eits_aapl</Username><Timestamp>1344220544829</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 22:35:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344222233349-211</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL in "breakout" mode above 620 early Monday August 6th</Title><Username>rndyjensen</Username><Timestamp>1344067693727</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 04:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what more do you need to know?, but buy this security, if you do options I would suggest the deeper in the money the better, for example "buy" the August 3rd 590 call, no premium, and it moves point for point at just a fraction of the cost, remember "the deeper in the money the better".

The new investors may buy convertible preferred securities, that is, bond-like equity with an option to change to a set number of common shares at an established price and at an exercise date in the future. Knight’s buyers of preferred would have the right to purchase about 270 million shares of Knight common stock at $1.50 a share. On Friday, Knight’s shares closed at $4, down from $12 two weeks ago. The equity infusion could dilute existing common shareholders by perhaps 60%, but Knight’s viability as an on-going concern is questionable without it. The preferred securities deal could give Knight sufficient capital to open on Monday for trading, filling the hole caused by errant trades that created about $440 million in losses on Wednesday. When Knights new preferred shares convert to common, the number of common shares outstanding would jump to 370 million from 100 million. The conversion date could be within 10 days, according to CNBC. The preferred securities would yield 2%, generating some limited short-term income for the investors. Knight’s investor consortium includes: private-equity firms General Atlantic and Blackstone Group and brokerage firms TD Ameritrade and Stifel Nicolaus, said CNBC. Investment bank Jefferies &amp; Co. may be the intermediary for sale. With heightened concern over the stability of high-frequency trading in the stock exchanges given the tumult of the Facebook IPO and the Flash Crash, the Knight investors face risks that Knight’s technical glitch may be the tip of the iceberg of many issues with the highly complicated trading algorithms. Goldman Sachs may be a major beneficiary of the Knight turmoil. Goldman could buy some of Knight’s inventory of 140 companies that it erroneously bought when its trading system got caught in a purchase loop, according to ZeroHedge. The Knight positions include many household names, like Alcoa and Verizon. On the morning of the trading disruption, Verizon, jumped from $44 to $47, for example. Goldman would pick up Knight’s inventory at fire sale prices without having to take on the risk of equity ownership in the exchange trader.</Msg><Username>lord_chatterly</Username><Timestamp>1344225272623</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 23:54:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
