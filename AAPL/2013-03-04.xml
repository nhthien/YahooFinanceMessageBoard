Prime example is Cricket Wireless expressing concerns that Iphones didnt sell to their expectations. They doubt if they can fulfill the contractual obligation to Apple. This will prevent other carriers from selling Iphones. This will cut into Apple's profit margin. Forget about a China Mobile deal. The Chinese government is supporting Huawei. This company has the potential to eclipse Samsung and Apple. Advice: sell and cut your loses.

What matters is the dividend yield. The stock price will continue lower and stabilize with a dividend yield about 3.5% or mid 300's. Sure it might overshoot lower, but that'll be due to margin calls and momentum.

It shouldn't get any better than this to buy and have substantial gains this year. This stock is a no brainer buy. When you subtract cash value of $100 per share its like buying aapl for $330 right now. That is ridiculous for the most profitable company in the world and the leader on all technology. With a few few n=bin=g things coming down the pike we should see some big days very soon. Even a little good news will become a big catalyst at these levels. Its very dangerous shorting at these levels. Congrats to all who shorted up to now but those days are numbered.

I ask this because that was the prevailing wisdom then. In the same vein, if you had shorted AAPL then and gone long BBRY, how beautiful would your portfolio had been? All the baboons on CNBC (including Cramer and the Fast Money talking heads) had declared RIMM dead and Canaccord was placing an $800 target on AAPL. So much for all the current predictions about the end of BlackBerry. Take my word: AAPL is done. The stock is headed long term to $280, and BBRY is definitely a $50 stock by the end of 2013. I have no apologies for saying this. I have used the BB z10, and it blows everything AAPL has released so far into the gutter. I'm waiting for AAPL to begin launching patent lawsuits all over the place to stop the BBRY momentum.</Msg><Username>a_sergeyevna</Username><Timestamp>1362383463133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 02:51:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362384322471-80</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL is a GIFT at $430...</Title><Username>ezraeellian</Username><Timestamp>1362377422963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 01:10:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I bought on Friday at 431 and I believe we will gap up $445 tomorrow with intraday high of 453 and close around $448.68-$452.78</Msg><Username>robbielolz</Username><Timestamp>1362384322471</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 03:05:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362384519698-81</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL is a GIFT at $430...</Title><Username>ezraeellian</Username><Timestamp>1362377422963</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 01:10:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you can never pick the bottom, dont be a kid and say better price...50 dollars maximum downside from this point...compared to 250 possible upside in the short term...wake up and smell the coffee, a company this good, with absolutely uncomparable products, cant lose too much more than this.Now is a great startpoint, and you can keep buying 50 grand at a time, every ten dollar drop.</Msg><Username>ezraeellian</Username><Timestamp>1362384519698</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 03:08:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362384584941-82</Id><Topic><Title>Compare AAPL and BBRY from Sept 19, 2012</Title><Username>a_sergeyevna</Username><Timestamp>1362383463133</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 02:51:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I've done a simple math od the whole thing. In the first example you would be losing $122,478 based on the closing prices for Sept 19 and March 1. You would gain an equal amount for the second scenario. Therefore the difference between the two traders in the two examples would be as follows: the AAPL lover will now have only $77, 522 left in his portfolio, while the BBRY realist would have $322,478, a difference of $244,956. I want anyone to dispute these figures. SELL AAPL now.

CNBC giving it life support... in your dreams, they are the biggest bashers of Apple. Momemtum buyers left a long time ago. Chasing Samsung? You can't be serious. Samsung is copying Apple. BTW, what are patents for? Of course they have to sue Samsung. They are infringing Apple's patents.

The company went from the most valuable company in the history of this country at $650+ billion to "only" $400 billion today. There is much hysteria regarding how "cheap" Apple is on one side whereas the other says the waterfall decline is warranted. Putting opinions aside, we can use one measure of profitability and management effectiveness to objectively ascertain whether or not Apple's management is getting the most from the company's assets. The metric I will use to demonstrate this point is Economic Value Added. If you are unfamiliar with EVA, the basic premise is that the company's asset base, which is defined as total assets minus current liabilities, gets "taxed" by the company's weighted average cost of capital. After-tax earnings must exceed this "taxed" amount in order to produce positive EVA. If EVA is negative, it means company management isn't producing enough income from the company's asset base to cover its economic cost of financing the assets.</Msg><Username>jnwanze</Username><Timestamp>1362400377232</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 07:32:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362400411181-211</Id><Topic><Title>Did Buffet just hint</Title><Username>aadaytrader</Username><Timestamp>1362400158388</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 07:29:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sounded like he likes aapl</Msg><Username>vetfrc</Username><Timestamp>1362400411181</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 07:33:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362400519492-212</Id><Topic><Title>Watch "House of cards" to see why NFLX up 107% in 2 month in 2013</Title><Username>aea_fyi2</Username><Timestamp>1362335001248</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 13:23:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_fyi2</Username><Timestamp>1362400519492</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 07:35:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362400557650-213</Id><Title>Buffet said AAPL cheap and great company and looking at options with tech</Title><Msg>Buffet getting in AAPL at these levels would be huge.</Msg><Username>buylow40</Username><Timestamp>1362400557650</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 07:35:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362400631476-214</Id><Title>Buffet evaluating stake in AAPL</Title><Msg>Wonder if it will be 3%, 5% stake, etc. he has the money for another elephant.</Msg><Username>buylow40</Username><Timestamp>1362400631476</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 07:37:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362400635110-215</Id><Topic><Title>BOYCOTT CNBC!</Title><Username>sameas55</Username><Timestamp>1359222162530</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-01-26 12:42:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree that stocks are not merited based on the fundamentals as they used to.

People get to caught up into these big wigs and hedge fund managers, they have so much of an advantage over the little guys. These guys are so crooked with their inside info. Look at Heinz SEC looking into that one as well. what a joke. They do it all the time the secret is to not get caught. and that's why they are the best. Not the best at their great financial future fortune telling but at using insider info to their benefit and getting away with it.</Msg><Username>stock4caster</Username><Timestamp>1362404876393</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 08:47:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362404881030-337</Id><Topic><Title>Apple open at 426</Title><Username>aea_fyi2</Username><Timestamp>1362404704564</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 08:45:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>wow!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>goldlstess</Username><Timestamp>1362404881030</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 08:48:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362404924329-338</Id><Topic><Title>Apple bottom when the street willing to talk about this qts earning</Title><Username>sonw_k22</Username><Timestamp>1362337921583</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-03 14:12:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>coming qtr will be a trainwreck for stock price.

My point is: Years ago, there's no way Mac's would be used by business people; they would own Windows-based products, which would mean it didn't matter what type of phone they owned, and I-Pads didn’t even exist. Apple's IOS-Cloud platform has created an ecosystem that has transformed the computer and phone industry, and will continue well into the future, and can be owned by anyone, even if you're not a billionaire! Of course, one nice thing about people who have more money owning these products is that they are quicker to upgrade, which means more profits for Apple.......and Apple's going broke???

He has to do this, as much as it hurts the common shareholder. The more AAPL falls, the cheaper it gets, and the more value per dollar of buyback money the company gets. Buying back at $350 rather than $500 is a huge difference. When those shares get bought back it will only add to EPS in the future. 20 billion dollars at $400/share can get the float down by 50 million shares. This can easily add to EPS by 3-5%. Read the Buffet article when he talks about how Berkshire lost half its value four times in its history. That's when the buybacks were more effective and then the stock came roaring back. I don't believe the hype that AAPL's earnings are crashing or the business is falling apart. No metric out there indicates that is really happening. The only thing that has happened is the stock has lost a mere 35%. It's nothing. The ground can be recovered in less than a year. Look at GOOG in 2009 and 2010. It plummeted but eventually came back. If you are holding for years, then you are in good shape. The near term future may be rough though.

Although some additional iPhone models are needed, in our view, more powerful is creating new product categories and pre-empting competition. CEO Tim Cook continues to emphasize that innovation is alive and well at Apple, and we’re inclined to believe him. Apple’s promise is superior performance at a reasonable price, which cannot be compromised. &#132; iWatch could be one new category Wearable computing seems a natural evolution for Apple with numerous recent media reports discussing a potential iWatch. A former Apple employee highlights that an iWatch could coordinate other Apple devices and provide new functions, such as eliminating entering passwords, finding your phone, supporting epayments, and enabling apps as another iOS platform. &#132; Valuation: Buybacks great, but story requires innovation We maintain our Buy rating and $600 price target (based on 10X F13e EV/FCF). We believe product innovation is the best thing that can happen to the stock.</Msg><Username>financefrau</Username><Timestamp>1362407392310</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:29:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362407393401-482</Id><Topic><Title>425 Is a Lock!</Title><Username>shortinguy</Username><Timestamp>1362401891918</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 07:58:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>preemptive bump for accolades.</Msg><Username>shortinguy</Username><Timestamp>1362407393401</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:29:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362407404736-483</Id><Topic><Title>LEAP SHARES FALL ON CONCERNS ABOUT SLOW IPHONES SALES .LEAP SHARES FELL 3 PERCENT</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1362085900705</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 16:11:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hugehugeblow to apple</Msg><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1362407404736</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:30:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362407413422-484</Id><Topic><Title>Buffet is loading AAPL here.

Everybody knows, whats going to help a raised divident and a huge stock buyback. But weeks go by and nothing from management. It's discouraging. Tim Cook says they are very very seriouse in returning cash, but yet nothing. It's like they are they don't want to see it or they are stuck in this we are King. Maybe true but the market is telling you something, "Return the cash!" I hope Apple's management sees what no action has been doing to the stock and the value that each shareholder has lost. I hope they really do something with their cash soon because at some point its going to be hard to get back to where Apple pnce was. We shouldnt even be at this $425 price. Apple should have annouced returning cash the day of earnings or even before. Well good Luck to all the longs.</Msg><Username>edwardc8622</Username><Timestamp>1362409266721</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:01:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362409271086-635</Id><Title>Apple $320. $40 earnings x 8 Multiple.</Title><Msg>Seems fair which means further downside.</Msg><Username>wes_w_weber</Username><Timestamp>1362409271086</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:01:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362409275049-636</Id><Topic><Title>Compare GOOG and AAPL charts today</Title><Username>stealthtradeinc</Username><Timestamp>1362408943945</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:55:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>...sounds like another AP... err GOOG fanboy.</Msg><Username>stealthtradeinc</Username><Timestamp>1362409275049</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:01:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362409277383-637</Id><Topic><Title>Some Support at 419, Then 409..</Title><Username>shortinguy</Username><Timestamp>1362408868909</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 09:54:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yeah there is support at 425.

Well, this, the Z10, suggests they’ve found it again. Within 30 seconds of picking it up, I felt as if I had the iPhone 6 in my hand. Running iOS 7. It is an awesome phone, with a pleasing new operating system, BB10. Both the BlackBerry Z10 hardware and the OS, a Canadian/Swedish/Australian co-production, could have the folks at Cupertino gnashing their teeth, because whatever iPhone upgrade they launch later this year or next, it will surely struggle to catch up. The Z10 looks like the iPhone 5 should have – a bit less tall and thin, a tad chunkier, a bit plastickier, but less chunky than the otherwise lovely (yet doomed) Nokia Lumia 920, which is a crucial 8 per cent wider and over a third heavier than the BlackBerry. It’s not just that the Z10’s physical form resembles a putative iPhone 6; BlackBerry has even designed its app icons to look as I suspect Apple might be redesigning them at this very minute. The Z10 is the fruit of the shake-up following BlackBerry’s dog days in 2011, and its decision to refocus on business users rather than rioters. The problem is that it could continue to appeal to the rioting community – not just because the beloved free BBM messaging system and signature red flashing message light remain, but because the Z10 is superb as a fun machine as well as a business tool. Indeed, it seems BlackBerry has been hoovering up all the clever little developers Apple should have bought. Take a look at the Z10’s analogue-style alarm clock when you play with one – and the genius Time Shift photo mode. Devotees of BlackBerry’s nasty (at least I think) little keyboard and tiny screen may be shocked by the Z10. Its 4.2in touch screen doesn’t even have a physical home button under it, and the phone is operated by single thumb gestures via what the makers call BlackBerry Flow – a rocking system that enables you to keep open multiple ap</Msg><Username>beavertailcanada</Username><Timestamp>1362409874627</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:11:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362409880542-697</Id><Title>looks like $360 is the next target after Q2</Title><Msg>hopefully we will get a 50 million volume print this week to price in the miss.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362409880542</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:11:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362409882876-698</Id><Title>March Call Options Vaporized..</Title><Msg>March call options really hit bad.</Msg><Username>calls_them_as_i_see_them</Username><Timestamp>1362409882876</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:11:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362409884995-699</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL is looking extremely hot.

I remember when apple was at 520 before earnings. Then, it looked like they beat a little (since they beat on every number except barely missing revenue). Then, the stock jumped to $530. When it started going to down, it hit $480, which was absurd. Then, it kept falling. The next day, when it briefly touched $450, I remember hearing some say "insanity" (and they were right).

BBRY is going to $50 before September, and AAPL is headed to $280. Its much praised cash is still untaxed money, and no matter how AAPL brings it back it faces taxation on at least two-thirds of it. You heard Buffet say it this morning. BBRY has made a product for which AAPL has no immediate answer, and the Financial Times has just said that too.</Msg><Username>a_sergeyevna</Username><Timestamp>1362412358189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:52:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362412359994-981</Id><Topic><Title>We will close over $432:</Title><Username>wchuck41</Username><Timestamp>1362412101535</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:48:21 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I meant exactly what I typed moron.</Msg><Username>wchuck41</Username><Timestamp>1362412359994</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:52:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362412361894-982</Id><Topic><Title>How long will the Board wait?</Title><Username>gfxsteve</Username><Timestamp>1362411845757</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:44:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they could have managed the dividend and buyback better last year. how? well they had no business adding fuel to the fire buy declaring it when the stock was flying at over 500 in january 2012. that caused the stock be parabolic and thus created a 700 plateau.if they would have waited they could have gotte more bang for the buck when it really was eeded this past fall.the stock would have had more support and less funds would have bailed out.</Msg><Username>cincinatikid99</Username><Timestamp>1362412361894</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:52:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362412365509-983</Id><Topic><Title>705 to 422</Title><Username>gfxsteve</Username><Timestamp>1362412011189</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:46:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course he did, he likes blowing things!</Msg><Username>bacowell</Username><Timestamp>1362412365509</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:52:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362412369134-984</Id><Topic><Title>That was THE BOTTOM: 423, congrats longs</Title><Username>cool_tropical_breeze</Username><Timestamp>1362411796397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:43:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stock now 424, I called the bottom.</Msg><Username>cool_tropical_breeze</Username><Timestamp>1362412369134</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:52:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362412399657-985</Id><Topic><Title>That was THE BOTTOM: 423, congrats longs</Title><Username>cool_tropical_breeze</Username><Timestamp>1362411796397</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:43:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>not yet it seems.</Msg><Username>wchuck41</Username><Timestamp>1362412399657</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:53:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362412407908-986</Id><Title>Bottoming and about to reverse</Title><Msg>Pattern showing hugely oversold condition with divergence on indicators that should precede a reversal of the trend.

"Don't forget that Apple, the company, is facilitating this carnage through secrecy and inaction." The market hates uncertainty, and when you do not give any information and throw investors a lifeline, most people will sell because there is nothing to give them hope or reason. I fail to understand how Tim Cook could take on his attitude. Yes, it's a great company, and yes, they have never bothered about the stock price. However surely as CEO you have SOME duty to choose your words and your presentation very carefully knowing full well that everyone is now looking at some sign. I believe EVERYONE, shorts included, know that AAPL is undervalued. All most people need is some ASSURANCE, some SIGN, some SIGNAL, of something positive from Cook, and they'd be ready to buy in again. The only possibility I could fathom is that either there are no new products coming up, or they don't mind prices dropping so that at very low prices they can do a buyback. More intelligent people than me will doubtless have more explanations, but with regards to Cook's inaction and at times seeming total disregard for shareholder concerns? I am flabbergasted as I am sure many people are.</Msg><Username>alpha2735</Username><Timestamp>1362413028493</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:03:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362413030442-1070</Id><Topic><Title>I am done</Title><Username>kerxxxlover</Username><Timestamp>1362412572657</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:56:12 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good 4 U.

So if analysts have estimates of $60/share for 2013 and AAPL comes in at $57, that's a bad 2013. I know you aren't this dumb. Why should AAPL change the phone, just for change's sake. Subtle redesign is exactly what they should be doing just like car manufacturer's - with design refresh and then a new body style every 5 years or so. You, like many others, are missing the point, Louis Vitton, Coach, Michael Kors don't change their logo every 5 years on their handbags because they're getting boring and stale. The iPhone 5 does many things the original iPhone did/could not. That is the beauty of AAPL products, you don't always have to update the hardware. Trying changing OS on an Android phone, you can't.</Msg><Username>monkey449</Username><Timestamp>1362413117704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:05:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362413118235-1080</Id><Topic><Title>remember when I post sell you fools it mean the smart people sells</Title><Username>raystock48079</Username><Timestamp>1362411745713</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 10:42:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Always remember that Raystock is both a liar and an idiot who is bullish at the top and bearish at the bottom but not man enough to admit to his losses or when wrong.

Such a device could produce $6 billion in revenue, the analyst says. That, the authors said, would make it more profitable for Apple than a similar share of the $119 billion television market, which might produce just $1.79 billion in annual profit versus $3.6 billion from watches.

(NASDAQ: AAPL) was at $500, $600 and even $700 per share one noted bear yelled from the top of the mountain that the stock was a "short of a lifetime." That bear was DoubleLine Capital's Jeff Gundlach. At that time many didn't give credence to Mr. Gundlach's call and chalked it up as just another disgruntled investor that missed the Apple boat. Well, Mr. Gundlach's ship has come in and he is getting the last laugh as today Apple hit his $425 price target. Gundlach has been critical of product innovation at Apple, specially the iPad mini. "When you just change the size of your current product, innovation just isn't there," he said.

But consistent with that, they could be a bot more active with their media relations. We know they retook smartphone leadership in the US... we know that the Mini is on fire and we know they must be making enormous and continuous enterprise deals with Fortune 500 companies. These stories have to be told not discovered. With respect to the financial engineering opportunities, a stock buy back would be antithetical to an increased dividend. Apple would undoubtedly enjoy significant capital appreciation when the oversold condition corrects to the upside.

And it was an unusual one, lasting through as much as eight years, which is rare to see. The stock was a leader in many stock market bull cycles, which is also not seen often. The situation we have right now is that it seems the market is anticipating further deterioration of future growth. Hence, the leadership of Apple in the future stock market cycles might be over. The fact is that the growth decelerated significantly, which caused the stock price to drop heavily. Analyst estimates are going down, from $49.28 expected EPS 90 days ago to $44.59 for this year and from $57.95 to $50.51 for 2014. This is normal for stocks when their high growth phase comes to an end. Based on the current valuation and growth expectations, Apple is still very, very cheap, but history shows that what is cheap, might become cheaper. -seekingalpha</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362414142770</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:22:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362414147059-1231</Id><Title>Samsung watching/waiting for iWatch</Title><Msg>Samsung must be watching and waiting for iWatch to come out so it can copy right away!</Msg><Username>nativecrafts</Username><Timestamp>1362414147059</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:22:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362414148264-1232</Id><Topic><Title>Cook will make an announcement</Title><Username>supercobra2013</Username><Timestamp>1362414086174</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 11:21:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You can bet all your money on that.

You have to have all the sellers gone in order for it to go back up. There is another possible reason. It has nothing to do with fundamentals or technicals, it has to do with innovation. the company is know for innovation and hasnt done anything in the last 4 yrs when it came out with the ipad. maybe people are finally seeing that the company is not innovating, thus moving on to better prospects.

The stock has going down 10% since he last time spoke . People dont believe on him and stock is impacting consumer.

Despite record setting profits and tremendous prospects for growth ahead, the company’s share price continues to drop. As of Monday morning, shares of Apple are down $7.04 for the day, trading at $423.49 per share. Overall, this is the lowest shares of Apple have been in well over a year. Early on Monday, famed investor Warren Buffet appeared on CNBC’s Squawk Box where he addressed Apple’s beleaguered share price. “I heard from people each time [Berkshire shares went down], saying why don’t you do this or that. Pay a dividend. I think Apple’s done a good job of building value. They may have too much cash. Now one reason they have so much cash is two thirds of it has not yet been taxed. Further, Buffet said that now may be a good time for Apple to buy back some of its own shares. On that note, Buffet relayed how Steve Jobs once called him up to discuss Apple’s growing cash hoard. “When Steve called me, I said, Is your stock cheap? He said, yes. I said, Do you have more cash than you need? He said, a little. [laughs] I said, then buy back your stock. He didn’t. Now, when our stock went from $90,000 to $40,000 to $45,000, I wrote about, we wanted to buy the stock. We didn’t quite manage to. “But if you could buy dollar bills for 80 cents, it’s a very good thing to do.” Steve Jobs, though, famously ignored Buffet’s advice and reportedly told people that Buffet had privately told him to do nothing with the cash. Oh Steve.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362418043584</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:27:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362418045964-1688</Id><Title>Apple will make $26 eps this year.

I think that, unlike the typical retail investor, fund managers are less tempted to sell into strength, especially given AAPL's longer term trading history.

Same $270 price target. Same advice to sell the stock short...” “I was right last year. I’ve been right over the last year, that’s all you can say,” Zabitsky told the Epoch Times, saying that his other stock picks are actually doing better. According to Starmine, a service provider for professional investors, Zabitsky was the best industry stock picker for semiconductors and semiconductor equipment over 2012. In his note from last year, as quoted by CNN Money, he cited widely available wireless internet as one of the reasons why Apple would soon run into trouble: “The internet is the great equalizer. It saved Apple during the rise of the wired broadband internet. It will level the playing field for other vendors with the rise of the true mobile broadband internet.” “People realize they can get the internet properties that they want, the key ones [Facebook, YouTube, Google Maps, Netflix, ESPN] they can get these basically anywhere,” he explained in a phone interview on March 1, 2013. “My targets are based upon my expectations for the business over a two year time frame. They are not based upon the current share price,” Zabitsky personally told Elmer-DeWitt last year, according to a CNN post. This illustrates the old investing adage that long-term investing can be very painful. If you have a contrarian call, you often have to wait a long time before the market follows suit. If your analysis is correct, you make money. If your analysis is incorrect, you will have already lost a lot of money before you realize it... As for the future, Mr. Zabitsky thinks that Apple will struggle with the low-end competition of what he calls “good enough” phones. They will be lower quality, but can essentially provide the same internet services for a much lower price. He doesn’t think Samsung will be the spearhead of this move, but rather a host of smaller companies in Asia.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362418801964</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:40:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362418807445-1816</Id><Topic><Title>HEADLINEEE HEADLINEEE INTEL WON'TTTT BUILD APPLE IPHONE CHIPPPP.ANOTHER HUGEHUGE BLOW TO APPLE</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1361974940336</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-02-27 09:22:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>INTEL SAY NO TO APPLE IPHONE CHIP</Msg><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1362418807445</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:40:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362418826496-1817</Id><Title>ANALYST EXPECTS THE WORSE EARNINGS EVER = TGT $50 SCAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</Title><Msg>sdvbdbdsbsd</Msg><Username>pharma.heroooo</Username><Timestamp>1362418826496</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:40:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362418831929-1818</Id><Topic><Title>AEA Frist HERE WE GOOOOOOOOOOOOOOO</Title><Username>aea_fyi2</Username><Timestamp>1362418316964</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:31:56 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>where is it 'going?.....down?....lol</Msg><Username>txtrader77</Username><Timestamp>1362418831929</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:40:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362418834631-1819</Id><Title>IPAD &amp; IPHONE HYPE IS GONE = AAPL IS FINISHED = TGT $50 OR LOWER WARNING</Title><Msg>dvsdvdbvds</Msg><Username>pharma.heroooo</Username><Timestamp>1362418834631</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:40:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362418844921-1820</Id><Topic><Title>Edward Zabitsky of ACI Research Reiterates Apple SELLTarget $270</Title><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362418801964</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:40:01 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“Some buyers are luxury high-end … there will always be that … A significant portion of buyers of iPhones have been value buyers, have been people who realized that they can get a lot of things in one place at a very reasonable price, who are no longer seeing Apple as the greatest value out there.” According to Zabitsky, Apple and other high-end brands also will no longer be able to count on its coolness factor to keep prices and margins high: “Coolness comes and coolness goes.

It's amazing investors are trading Goog this much higher with a PE that has always been higher than Apples and today approximately 200 percent higher. This market listens to analyst while not looking at balance sheets or doing some of their own due diligence. It's a wonder why the analyst over all cannot even beat the S&amp;P but investors still listen. It's all new for lots of investors and the amount of money being taken in today from money managers is huge compared to a short time ago. I cannot allow someone to control my own actions let alone my money. It's a financially lazy market out there and MM will take money no matter what the market is doing. They are scheming a reason to capitalize on your money since your to lazy to even try to understand this market. Wake up out of the brainwashing and research for yourself and see some obvious steps that need to be done before you lose lots of money.</Msg><Username>xtrees</Username><Timestamp>1362419170390</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:46:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362419181846-1867</Id><Topic><Title>I wonder what price AAPL really wants to buy their stock back at?</Title><Username>jr_jeffrey</Username><Timestamp>1362418791108</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:39:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If I was Cook, I would have bought it all back when it dropped below $500 post earnings.

AAPL better come up with something fast or they'll be yesterday's news. You need to look at HIMX. Its been on the move lately. Just buy it and put a sell limit a ways under it when it gets to $6. and move your stop up if it increases. That's all you have to do. I only need to look at a few pieces of data about a stock. You don't need an in depth analysis to do what I do. I figure most of you are here because you don't understand much about stocks.

It's just one line words about shorts and pumpers. Surely if you want to talk about Obama or jews or whatever, there is a reddit site or something that they could use where they wouldn't have to wade through discussions about stocks. Anyway, I bought 100 shares of AAPL at 438 on Friday and I'm hoping for a turn around.

Apple, Inc. (Nasdaq: AAPL) is hovering near annual lows again Monday as investors are becoming more nervous about the future of the company. According to reports from TheVerge and Bloomberg on Monday, Apple might cannibalize itself via creation of a wristwatch, dubbed the "iWatch." Apple design chief Jony Ive is said to have ordered "boxes" of Nike (NYSE: NKE) sport watches a few years back, Bloomberg noted. The goal was for engineers to take apart and inspect the devices in hopes of evolving the product into something worthy of the Apple name. Instead of using the iPad Nano's touch operating system, engineers are expected to port over a version of iOS to run on the iWatch... Apple may need to release the device before the end of the year as well, with analysts starting to figure a new device into their estimates already... Investors may be hoping for the best, too; many skeptics have surfaced in recent years since the passing of Steve Jobs that innovation has been lost at Apple. Multiple versions of iPhones, iPads, and iPods can only hold attention for so long before another ground-breaking product would be needed. But, should Apple be able to debut a new wristwatch this year and if said watch should run on iOS, the question might now be whether or not consumers will need an iPod, iPad, AND iPhone...or could one be cut out.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362419820225</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:57:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362419836328-1950</Id><Topic><Title>seriously, the AAPL</Title><Username>abcdsteve123</Username><Timestamp>1362419740773</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:55:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Thats what i have been saying.

If Apple had new products to offer they could confirm this, especially now, and damn their culture of secrecy. If Apple wanted to return some cash back to shareholders, they could have done this yesterday. They know what investors are asking/looking for. If institutional investors and hedge funds believed in what we are hoping for from Apple, they would not be selling Apple every second of every day for 6 months now. Apple doesn't appear to have products coming out that will add to growth 6 months from now. If they did, Apple stock price woulkd not be in free-fall. I now believe that Apple is its own worst enemy. They need new management from outside of the company, not promoted from within like Cook was. Their thought-process over the last 6 months is flawed. Everything changed but they just do not get it. They need a change of leadership.</Msg><Username>imaginejml</Username><Timestamp>1362420642404</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:10:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362420647079-2043</Id><Title>FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY ANY DAY NOW SCAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</Title><Msg>dfb dfbdbsb</Msg><Username>pharma.heroooo</Username><Timestamp>1362420647079</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:10:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362420655087-2044</Id><Topic><Title>Apple good to buy at 420 or lower for this week trading</Title><Username>aea_fyi2</Username><Timestamp>1362417006260</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 12:10:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggggg</Msg><Username>aea_fyi2</Username><Timestamp>1362420655087</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:10:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362420656078-2045</Id><Title>FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY ANY DAY NOW SCAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</Title><Msg>dsbdbdsbsdb</Msg><Username>pharma.heroooo</Username><Timestamp>1362420656078</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:10:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362420664353-2046</Id><Title>FILES FOR BANKRUPTCY ANY DAY NOW SCAMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMMM</Title><Msg>dvbsdbsdb</Msg><Username>pharma.heroooo</Username><Timestamp>1362420664353</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:11:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362420670460-2047</Id><Title>SUBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBBB PENNYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYYY LEVELLLLLL COMINGGGGGGGGGGGGG</Title><Msg>sdvbdsbdsbb</Msg><Username>pharma.heroooo</Username><Timestamp>1362420670460</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 13:11:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362420676416-2048</Id><Title>WE bought at 421.32 today</Title><Msg>Wev are glad somone sold so cheap .

I have been going short after 3:00 PM since Valentine's day. Every day but 2 I have made very good money . 1 of those days I was even and I lost a little the other. AAPL is looking weak again today. I am not one that things this stock is a piece of garbage. I am actually waiting for an opportunity to go long because I still think it is a great company. It is just that the big money is playing this company at present on the short side. Today they could decide to cover and go long. I have no idea when they will do that. I watched DE go from 90+ to 20+ in just over 10 months. When DE was 90 I thought it was a great company and at 24 I thought it was a great company. Sure it was worth more than 24 but the big money was making the money on the short side. Wall Street doesn't care about you and I. They take no prisoners. So I have not idea how low they may take AAPL. If we do have a correction in the market it will go much lower in my opinion which means little.

He owned the public discourse in a powerful, yet usually subtle way. Tim Cook has completely lost control of the narrative. Guys like Jeff Gundlach and David Einhorn dictate the pace. That's unheard of at Apple. The blame begins and ends with Tim Cook. Apple must act. It must act to regain control of the situation. If it's not prepared to do that with new and exciting products, it needs to point the reality distortion field away from itself and back at everybody else ...

The purported 5S would be equipped with support for China‘s home-grown “TD-SCDMA” 3G network, speculates Hoffman, drawing in part upon work from his colleague, chip analyst Timothy Arcuri. Arcuri thinks that construction of a 5S is trending to June, which is later than the April “ramp” that Hoffman had been modeling. He thinks a phone will arrive in the fiscal fourth quarter of this year, the September-ending period. Hoffman also speculates Apple will have “at least one iPhone model with a 5″ display for late 2013/14,” he writes, which might “shore up the platform”: Smartphone announcements at last week’s Mobile World Congress continue to signal a market shift away from small displays (e.g. LG’s Optimus G Pro display measures 5.5″; ZTE’s Grand Memo has a 5.7″ display). Checks at MWC strongly suggests Apple will add an iPhone variant with a 5+” display. At the same time, Hoffman thinks retailers in Europe are cutting prices to move iPhone units: Our European contacts suggest that channel remains well (over?) supplied with iPhones, though robust promotional activity is now helping to spur demand. What is less clear is exactly how much support Apple is providing for those clearing campaigns. We note demand elasticity for lower-priced Apple smartphones remains high; remember that the $100 or so price cut on the iPhone 4S and 4 drove both SKUs into shortage during F1Q13.

Watches? Let me guess, they will be "amazingly thin..." Could you imagine Steve Jobs rethinking the "watch?" The last nano had aftermarket accessories to be a watch but I do not remember anyone thinking it was a 100 billion dollar idea. Apple's obsession with "smallness" rather than large screens is going to be an issue when the large screen is prettier to look at. The new watch will probably be a bent bengal lcd screen which can have "faux" leather or metal wallpaper "bands" and fake clasp to boot. Inspiration, where is it and where did it come from? Your assumption this is the bottom is a rather large one.

Earlier we noted that with Apple shares falling below $425, it was another feather in the cap for investing god Jeff Gundlach, who predicted last year that Apple would hit this level in 2013. It's important to note what a good call this was. Back at the time the stock was close to $600. We asked Gundlach, via email, whether he had any additional thoughts on Apple's remarkable decline. His short reply is that the decline is a milestone for market theory: AAPL over the last six months offers a textbook case study in market behavior and effectively debunks efficient market theories. The weakness is all the more remarkable because it has occurred within the context of a strong overall US stock market. SPX up 5% since September 19, 2012 and AAPL down 40%. The efficient markets hypothesis basically states the markets are always accurately factoring in all relevant information about a security, and are pricing said security "correctly." From his viewpoint, this proves that markets are not perfectly rational and efficient digesters of news and data, but rather the product of herds and behavioral idiosyncracies, at least somtimes. Apple is a shining example of how it all works.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1362427988450</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 15:13:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362428015331-2562</Id><Title>$390s this week?

Down almost $100 a share since the last earnings call, and that shareholder meeting last week was a total waste as far as getting any good news out of these idiots.

Market DOES digest news and data rationally and efficiently! Here is what is being digested: 1. Steve Jobs is dead! no more innovations. Steve Jobs used to be the vice president of product innovations in Apple. 2. iPhone market is saturated, with not only its own products, but also competitors like Samsung, Huawei, etc. 3. Competitiors' products are better and much cheaper, who doesn't want cheaper products, unless you are iDiot. 4. Apple has been resizing its iPad from standard to mini-iPad, that is a very stupid thing to do, people don't want a mini-iPad, because the mini one is iPhone, that's the miniest iPad. iPeople have already got it. 5. Almost everybody is in a 2-year contract with carriers, few customers left in the market for iPhones. 6. Apple is suing Samsung for frivolous reasons, exposing its weakness. 7. Samsung will continue to develop better products and sell them cheaper, destroying Apple. 8. iWatch is simply stupid! 9.

Many years ago, in my early investing/trading days, I learned the hard way about "falling in love" with a stock, "catching a falling knife", "fighting the tape" (stock-specific or otherwise), and telling myself "just hold on... it will come back". Fortunately for myself, the lesson I learned was only a bruise that I was able to overcome in time. I do feel sorry for the "newbie" longs who are in that "learning" phase and only hope for their sake they learn to recognize their ills sooner rather than later. To the "newbie" longs who have lost a lot in AAPL... do not become discouraged by the losses, use the (learning) experience to your advantage for future investments/trades. All the best to you.

You longs were more interested in dissing and taunting. That approach cost you 40% of your equity,if you have any left. And those issues and concerns have come to fruition in several areas. Margin contraction - stiff competition (make sure you continue to deny that) - lack of any new product innovation (and spare us the watch and T.V. nonsense) - management capabilty which is now in question. (you should have sold every share after the Brian William's interview) . Apple is now a commodity company.

I am an AAPL bull, and I know it will recover it the long term, but most folks aren't long term. They want AAPL to do or say something now, which AAPL refuses to do. AAPL leadership and BOD won't even hint at any new products, new markets, or possible cash return to shareholders. The absence of any news is viewed as a negative. This is probably a good time to add to your position. Not all in, but add.

Cook is not and should not be worried about short term stock price movements. If he did, he wouldn't have time to run the world's most profitable company. Second, long term? What 5 months? Not long term. If you think AAPL doesn't return to more than $705 a share, you deserve to lose money. If you have been buying calls, then you are going to lose money. Buy stock and hold on.

Most of these rumors are being started by Apple's competitors.

It is easy to forget that, but the fact that you even view (much less post to) a forum like this one indicates that you are FAR more aware of AAPL's price movements than 99.9999% of people. Hell, one time last year (when AAPL was going UP like a rocket) I was in an Apple Store and I happen to make a comment about the stock price to one of the employees. Keep in mind that this was when the stock had gone up over $200 in a few months. He had no idea what the stock price was doing.

The price action of its stock is reminiscent of the "forced selling" that is done when a bubble pops. I am not saying that Apple was in a bubble, but that is irrelevant. What happens when a bubble pops is that crazy people who have margined way beyond their means have to get out due to margin calls. What's even worse is that each time they sell, the price goes lower, thus causing even more margin calls not only for themselves but also for others. This domino effect is what causes the price behavior to look irrational. Compounding this effect is the fact that institutions that are value based will not buy Apple until they think they can get it for very cheap, thus the mantra "There is a huge gap between when a growth investor sells and when a value investor buys." With major buyers waiting for the stock to get really cheap, there is no support for the stock, and the forced selling continues unabated. (Note that I do not believe Apple has necessarily become a value stock, but that is the current perception) So what about the company itself? If you look at Tim Cook, you get the idea that he is a tightwad who will drive a hard bargain. He will not want to initiate more buybacks until the stock is "fire sale" cheap. Furthermore, it is my view that he does not care for shareholders: to him they are like parasites that are riding on Apple's success. (He congratulates his employees for their excellent hard work, but calls Einhorn's proposition "A silly sideshow") What he does not understand is that the shareholders are the ones that provide the capital for the company. Although they ride the success, they also suffer the risks and losses in the investment. If he does not care for the shareholders, then why stay public. Take the company private. So what can one do to profit from this situation?

We all have been there and it hurts . . .a lot. For a long time I have been urging every one to look at Apple and at least consider what I have seen coming. The girl that you took to the dance is gone. Apple is a good company, but not invincible. They had a very hot and profitable set of products ( really one in different sizes) However the ability to continue enormous profits has ended and therefore the stock will continue to reflect that.. If you don't want to believe me and sell now at LEAST buy long term puts in sufficent quantity to cover your long position. This will protect you from further loss and you will still have your stock in case there are some rises in the future. My real advice to you is though sell now as it has about another $100 to go down yet, and will be getting there after this quarters results are shown.</Msg><Username>waldo.ferris</Username><Timestamp>1362433670529</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:47:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362433680534-3336</Id><Title>Only gay longs are holding and buying AAPL stocks so they can get reamed.</Title><Msg>You know the drill pretty boy, bend over and grab them ankles, is it gonna be with or without the KY today.</Msg><Username>vogue1254</Username><Timestamp>1362433680534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:48:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362433686620-3337</Id><Topic><Title>AAPL Longs DO NOT sell or worry..

As of last quarter AAPL had $7.5 billion in stock repurchase authorization. At a price of $450 (just to make the math easy) they can purchase over 16.5 million shares, compared to purchasing shares at a fair value of $600, or 12.5 million shares. AAPL currently has no incentive to help drive the price higher. AAPL investors should take this in consideration and AAPL traders should also take note. Traders should keep trading and use technical indicators to make as much money as possible. However, if you are an AAPL investor, not a trader who got trapped, keep your shares and the faith. As soon as AAPL has an incentive to raise their share price they will have more then enough weapons to make it happen...P.S. if you are still shorting the stock, please keep shorting the stock, so AAPL can repurchase more shares.</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1362434296420</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 16:58:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362434300273-3391</Id><Title>Just saw this headline: Apple Analyst Andy Zaky Lost $10.6 Million Of Other People's Money In The Apple Crash</Title><Msg>This is the result of a dumb Apple Lover.

I do in GOOG. Sold AAPL on the way up at $500. Had it for YEARS too with breaks when TA broke twice at $200. That pop to $700 never fazed me because the money I took made as much or more. Now, first, one never tries to catch a falling knife. Pure foolishness.Never fight a tape(or sentiment).AAPL was a SELL at $500 on the way up!! The chart turned down LT and only irrational exuberance kept it rising. It ran into the law of large #s. This is NOT a high growth stock anymore. It has to transition to a mature stock and that is painful, especially when they horde their cash. No acquisitive growth like GOOG. GOOG was criticized for YouTube, Double Click and Motorola. Yea,well GOOG folks are smart and noone touches them in search. Jobs' death meant the end of the next great thing too. The last next great thing was the IPad which came out of Steve's head.And the real killer-AAPL has lost its "cool" factor to competition. Check out the phones of teenagers. Not so much AAPL anymore.You're dead wrong IMO, but I wish you the best of luck. Now, when the long GOOG/short AAPL trade ends(it's crowded), AAPL gets a pop probably-a huge bear trap IMO.

There is a good chance that they will report another monster quarter, most likely reporting the highest gross income amongst all publicly traded companies. The Street will look at YOY figures and gross margin and say they are signs of concern. And they will be right, sort of, this is because they do not want you to buy the stock while they are buying the stock. Then when the company reports in July they will crush the YOY figures, they will probably have a new product on the market, and the stock will go on a rampage up to the high $500's only to go back down during the fourth quarter. Around this time the company will also double their dividend to 5%. This is when the Street will recommend you buy the stock, becuase they will already be priced in, and therefore they will make a killing.</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1362435419534</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 17:16:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362435456226-3455</Id><Title>Made $130K...thanks.

I don't see any near term catalysts that will move this stock in a positive direction. Galaxy S4 release on the 14th will be bad for Apple, and earnings are not going to be good either, which always hammer this stock. So if it gets cheap again I'll buy back, but at this point anything over 400 is still expensive given the lack of a catalyst going forward and what the chart says. Tim Cook has proven he is not going to act on investor desires/wants. I don't know how this man will be as a CEO over the next year but he hasn't done much that I have been impressed with.

I suspect the market for the watch - after the usual cult buyers buy it - will be zero. And if they price the watch as badly as they priced the mini (which was the start of the price decline) look out below. The consumer is catching on to Apple's game. And that is you can get an equally high quality product w/o paying Apple prices, And in this economy the broke consumer is veeeeeery conscious of that. The T.V.?? A very,very low margin sector. And Apple intends to price the T.V.'s in the $2000 plus range. Say goodnoght. Samsung,Sony and Hitachi make superior LED sets for a whole lot less.

AAPL will not announce a buy back until the current $7.5bil in repurchase authorization is spent. Which could be done by the end of the next quarter. At that time they will probably announce another $10bil in repurchases and double the dividend. It hurts to watch the stock today, but by the end of the year it will soar.</Msg><Username>wait4itorsell</Username><Timestamp>1362435955505</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 17:25:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362435993841-3478</Id><Topic><Title>Response I got when emailing customer relations.

Apple is no weaker than it was in September, and neither Google nor Samsung are any stronger. The market has turned against Apple because the street got irrationally exuberant, and a lot of investors followed them up - which was a perfect setup for the traders to knock it down as soon as daily volume lagged. You're not the worst investor unless you sell and bake in your losses without a plan. Do you have a good advisor? Speak to him/her, get their help in constructing a balanced portfolio, and whether or not selling AAPL here makes sense for you. AAPL is my largest single stock holding, and yet, as it's been slaughtered, my portfolio value has been stable or very slightly up. I've just bought some more healthcare - I own IHE, and it's done very well, up more than 17% since I bought it less than a year ago, and today bought some XLV, to dilute out my AAPL. Just stay calm.

THis is unprecedented in AAPL's history. THis completely separate universe to the reality of the market is confusing at the least. If you have common, I suggest holding. If you have calls- I suggest praying. The longer they depress this- the better the chance that future call written last year will be wiped out. After all, wasn't this the original plan? It has worked beyond their brightest forecast. What holds the longs in disbelief is how this could be when a company is earning 40B per year, with zero debt, and has a proven track record of 27% growth for 24 qtrs. in a row. Don't ponder this too long, it will only drive you crazy. THe fact is: 1) AAPL has been under a coordinated attack since Sept 21. 2) Unless Apple management continues to not step up and counter we will continue to witness the free-fall. Eventually, management will say something or do something- lets hope the damage done is recoverable. -Stealth</Msg><Username>stealthtradeinc</Username><Timestamp>1362437409299</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 17:50:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362437414191-3567</Id><Topic><Title>I am finished.</Title><Username>agentkagent</Username><Timestamp>1362436786244</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 17:39:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You were right to sell.

This is not a Sony yet. It sells products that people want, need, and upgrade often. People do not trow out TVs every 2 years, but they do upgrade their cell phone every 2 years. People will revisit this growth story soon. You should get a divided pop (and/or buyback) in the next couple of weeks. You should also start getting interesting numbers from China embedded within an inline Q1 report perhaps reminding people that this is still an aspirational brand in parts of the world. But you will not make a profit until the company shows it can disrupt new markets. iWatch, iTV and who knows what else, it can technically buy Tesla for chump change and really disrupt a huge market icar would send this stock to new highs and even 1000. But from where we are today this requires dreaming.

As Buffet says, he should ignore the noise and stay concentrated in running the business well as he always has.

Think the price drop is significant now? Wait till T-Mobile drops their subsidies, with ATT, Verizon, and Sprint all following suite, customers will be paying the full unsubsidized price, what effect on the Apple stock price do you think that will have? With Nokia's new factory coming on line next month, somewhere in the 50 million unit range per quarter, with Nokia pushing out volumes in the low, medium, and high end, at what point will Nokia surpass the number of handsets that Apple is selling on a per quarter basis, what effect do you think will have on the Apple stock price? Unless Apple has some real tricks up their sleeves, just set back and watch Apple continue to head lower to areas of support, consolidate to the point where support becomes resistance, then each leg down will become more and more painful. Even the high today was below the 52 week low, Apple stock is in serious trouble.

But more people start considering shorts, and more people bet on that. As soon as there is an opportunity to extract more money out of the shorts rather than expired options, the price can be driven up. I think it's time for those who want to donate their life savings to MMs, to stop buying options, and start shorting. Your sacrifice will be appreciated.

They have numerous reasons and blame game rationales for the decline. Everything is a conspiracy - everybody who dares to discuss and document the concerns is put upon. The stock is dpwn for real reasons. Reasons pertaining to the fundamentals and how those fundamentals apply to the future growth prospects of the company. And how thw Market values those prospects. Clearly,there are many who now question the outlook for the company and the prospects.They have been discussed here in detail and won;t rehash them. But the longs are more interested in trash talk issing those that discuss the issues instead of objectively considering them. If you longs disagree that's fine.But this daily nonsensical ranting and raving against all that you perceived as causing you your losses only identifies your amateurish inexperience. The fact is you caused your losses. You bought the stock (anyone who bought options excluded - they never had much of a chance)to start with)- you should know that stocks have principle risk and that it went against you. It happens. Somehow you felt that loss potential didn't apply with Apple. You know - it's APPLE - God of God,King of Kings. and such. You made your call - you lost. Acceot it,learn from it,move on. Stop blaming everyone else. Grow up,the world is real.

Apple's stock price is nearly 20 times higher. At Apple's current stock price, 1 billion of their cash will buy back only a little over 2 million shares. They could spend 25% of their free cash and only get back 10 million shares. There lies your problem. The stock needs to be a lot lower in order for a buy back to have any effect and increasing the dividend uses up cash so that's not going to help. You also need a good dividend yield of 3% or better to entice income investors. So , again the stock price needs to be much lower for income investors. As far a new product announcement, there talking about getting into watches? How about toothbrushes?

Market makers all talk together and work the price to their advantage. However, I have to say that Apple leaves the door wide open to be kicked around. It would be so damn easy for them to make several versions of the iphone, one with bigger screen (bye bye samsung), one with a flip out key board (bye bye rimm). there is no question about Apples quality, its just that they are too damn stubborn to seize an opportunity! But when you consider quality, you cant compare Apple to samsung! I have used android devices and they lock up all the time. Apple products never lock up! and they last forever! But they could be a bit smarter about fending off competition... and also be a little more shareholder friendly! The only reason "smart investors" are holding back... of course, they want it as cheap as they can get it! so its to their advantage to sit back and let the MM's and hedge funds tear the living sh*t out of it so they can scoop up the bargain after the dust has settled.</Msg><Username>spectate_ulator</Username><Timestamp>1362440549919</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 18:42:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362440559074-3745</Id><Title>New Apple Fanbois Less Clever Than Last Years</Title><Msg>this is going to be easier than i had originally thought.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1362440559074</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 18:42:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362440616849-3746</Id><Topic><Title>I bet everything I had at $675, and I am leveraged up the YING YANG to average down, buying more and more and more but</Title><Username>large.ivory</Username><Timestamp>1362440539378</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 18:42:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I can provide CNBC's address.

The brokers create the demand and supply. If you are their friend, you can bet with them and if you are not their friend they can bet against you. Stories,tales, rumors and Marketing are their weapons along with a 10 day volume. A 10 day volume can rinse the calls and puts a long way until the retail investors or institutional investors get interested in the stock. It started before the earnings. CNBC,news articles. Bear case for AAPL etc. Earnings though good, did not meet the high end of the analyst estimate, If AAPL/TC was smart, he would have anticipated this move and announced a buyback during the call. Now the damage is done more than anticipated. It is like steering a bus without brakes on a downhill/ uphill road. Downhills will be faster and uphills will be tough to hold on to.. The support is broken easily and it will not be far before big funds start to unload if TC does not act to provide a solid base. KKD is an example. It does not matter if the PE is 1 or .01. The company needs to provide support for its broken stock. Fix the breaks.</Msg><Username>mani_v_in</Username><Timestamp>1362443326582</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 19:28:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362443376795-3852</Id><Topic><Title>I'm long AAPL and short LNKD.

I'll give you an idea of how to handle it if you still believe in APPLE long-term (as Time Cook said people should). First there may well be more excitement about Apple mid-year when alot of articles say Apple will be introducing new Smartphones. (right now Samsung and Blackberry have intro'd new phones). So the thing to do is buy Call Options on Apple Stock for this Fall. Buy "in the money calls" and you won't pay that high a premium above the current market price of the stock... and yet you'll need a lot less capital to own the potential appreciation, than from owning the shares outrighe. Options are risky though--- its taking a chance.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1362443680108</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 19:34:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362443683348-3865</Id><Topic><Title>I'm long AAPL and short LNKD.

Obviously you're just upset and talking. No-one knows the future, but the problems will pass. I think Apple stock will have recovered alot by the Fall. And who knows, maybe the Board or Cook will get off their rears and finally act on some of the proposals to raise Div...etc. Mr. Cook said "they were seriously considering". So far its mostly "HYPE SPIN" by some news media claiming to know that Apple is not a growth company anymore. But that may only be for one quarter. So far there's been NO BAD RESULTS (last quarter had over $23 billion pos. cash-flow, the most ever, and the earnings were a bit higher than the prior year, and sales growth if adjusted for 14 weeks instead of 13 weeks was actually pretty good 27% instead of 18%).

Some of his stocks took decades to become winners. Look at his portfolio sometime. He's held onto shares that dropped 50 percent or more. Of course, he has a long-term viewpoint, not the instant gratification that young people expect today. Probably, you churned your own accounts or didn't manage risk effectively.

Today was a 'tester' for the market....please look at the daily charts and dare me if I am wrong. The markets came up in the last hour today and it will be an up week all week long. Yes, Apple ended up down but it was much due to the month long haircut. This week, the markets will end up significantly (if the US does not decide to do a pre-emptive strike on Iran, which is likely to happen before June 1st)...and AAPL will end up about 460 or 470 by weeks end. Please understand that Apple is still a risk only because of a TON of issues going on right now at the company. The biggest reason? Major investors are physically LAUGHING at the iWatch....they laughed and then sold their shares and then they shorted the shares!!!! There are major reasons to be concerned about Apple but there is a major correction occurring this week to the upside. So hold tight until month end...and then, it is anybody's guess. But by end of March Apple should be at the 525 range.</Msg><Username>mytoessmell</Username><Timestamp>1362447134249</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 20:32:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362447142339-4050</Id><Title>What is going to stop AAPL from tumbling some more?

They would make much more money just 1/ getting a relationship started with China mobile and 2/ making a cheaper more utilitarian phone for developing markets. Maybe take a page out of Nokia's book but don't buy them as I stand to make a lot money riding that pony that Apple. Management here cannot multitask. CEO's job is much more than just creating and selling good products. He employs people do these functions. Jonny Ive has been quiet of late. Is he still with the Company or has he been fired as well. Apple now is like a possessed beast living in tis own world deliberately trying to isolate itself from the business community. almost like it is trying to hide something. Is Jonny Ive still alive? If he goes this ship will really sink. and to think I have been one of the believers since this stock was $12. The magic has left this Company. Nothing inspirational or idealistic about this Company anymore. Like a dog and its master, it has died with Steve. God bless his soul.

And where are you going to put that glassed when it made a impression your nose. Contact was created because people don't want to wear glasses. Lasik was created because people don't like even to wear contacts. Now watches people wear them without thinking about them. Imagine something around your wrist that you can make calls.

Apple said their Income Tax rate was 26%, not 56^ which reducing $150 Bn. in cash you assume overseas down to $70 Bn. would require. Also Apple doesn't have $150 Bn. overseas,.. .they ahve about $40 Bn. already in USA already paid taxes on, so that leaves about $100 Billion overseas,. and only 26% tax would be required if they want to bring the earnings to USA. So that would make well over $110 Billion cash in USA after -tax.</Msg><Username>aiwal1</Username><Timestamp>1362451911619</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:51:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362451912136-4246</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer says Apple will be in the 200's</Title><Username>maros47</Username><Timestamp>1362451270508</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:41:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>lolol</Msg><Username>maros47</Username><Timestamp>1362451912136</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:51:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362451925140-4247</Id><Title>What did the Pirate say to the Iphone</Title><Msg>iEye What did the Analyst say to the AAPL shareholder iLie</Msg><Username>x2in024me</Username><Timestamp>1362451925140</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:52:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362451925394-4248</Id><Title>Weeden and co (trade gone wrong)</Title><Msg>I wonder what this firm is proposing now...... http://blogs.barrons.com/techtraderdaily/2013/01/29/aapl-stock-oversold-says-weeden-sell-puts-for-move-to-520/</Msg><Username>premiumdraft</Username><Timestamp>1362451925394</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:52:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362451955020-4249</Id><Title>will not close any lower will be up</Title><Msg>i was waiting for this over 2 months and will not go much lower but closing will be up . gap filed</Msg><Username>stonetech</Username><Timestamp>1362451955020</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:52:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362451994724-4250</Id><Topic><Title>Cramer says Apple will be in the 200's</Title><Username>maros47</Username><Timestamp>1362451270508</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:41:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are a liar and an idiot</Msg><Username>ocsdspider</Username><Timestamp>1362451994724</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 21:53:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362452033396-4251</Id><Title>Tim Cook Shorting Apple?</Title><Msg>There is some evidence I have found for this on Google.

AAPL has a current MAF stock rating of 4 "Normal Downtrend". AAPL needs to close above the FMA-1% price of $421.01 tomorrow to avoid further price destruction. The only thing that can save AAPL stock from further declines is Apple Inc. itself. A good quality stock will maintain a MAF Stock Rating of 5 and higher. If you want to stop losing money, do yourself a favor and sell your stock if it falls to a MAF Stock Rating of 4. That is what happen to AAPL stock when it fell from $700 and you know what happened after that.

For all we know, Apple may be on the verge of delivering the next big thing, but, what is perceived out there in the tech world, there is a definite perceived lack of innovation since Steve Jobs mortal departure. Just listen to the media, they dont seem to like Cook. So that and the perceived lack of product innovation is causing the lackluster performance of said stock and company. Personally, I think he needs more time to prove himself. The company was so wrapped around Jobs, that to disconnect that culture is very tough for the successor to do. Again, a great example is Bill Gates and Steve Ballmer.</Msg><Username>eyt39bnp</Username><Timestamp>1362457527033</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:25:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362457544409-4409</Id><Topic><Title>I am finished.</Title><Username>agentkagent</Username><Timestamp>1362436786244</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 17:39:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stocks usually bounce back when u feel like this.

In a sense Apple corp. had not much to do with stock pricing, when you bought you were under the illusion that apple stock (by itself ) had a justification for such price ($650), when in reality it was wall street who drove the price up by greed (calling it a "growth stock"), apple kind of fell for it and the proof is: they did not split the stock allowing it to go so high and took advantage of the momentum in sales growth due to their phone market and tablet market dominance. Steve Jobs was good at many things and so this stock performed well under him, but not the case Tim Cook, unfortunately he will not do any good. Now, here is what is going on (IMHO), Wall street knows apple won't be the same success story it was before (see proof in the last 3 quarterly reports, don't be fooled by them making money but concentrate on the fact that they showed a slow down). Wall street dislikes Tim Cook, they know were Tim is going, Tim if not dismissed will turn apple in to a company that introduces minimal changes in their products and cater to a niche paying for an overprice item in a saturated market, he will soon attempt to get higher pay as a CEO since Wall Street killed the options trading (see every Friday's closing). In the end it does not matter how much wall street tells you this is a good stock $500 or $800, in reality no stock should be price that high in retail, same goes for Google Inc.</Msg><Username>dick.harper</Username><Timestamp>1362457593680</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:26:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362457596601-4412</Id><Topic><Title>if AAPL drops to 350 tomorrow i would definitly mortg my house to buy.!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Username>kat9089</Username><Timestamp>1362457059796</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:17:39 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This one has been on my radar for some time.

Even more pathetic longs that get rattled by what the shorts are saying. Too much complaining by the longs and too much gloating by the shorts. Simple truth. AAPL fell a small 2.5% yesterday and everyone is acting like it's the end of the world. And yes, I know it's fallen 36% since it's peak. So what? Check Google's price in late 2008 to late 2009 and then again in the first half of 2010. Same story as AAPL now. All the shorts were gloating constantly on the GOOG board. They were saying how FB was going to be the end of GOOG. GOOG was done innovation. Android was a joke etc. etc. Now it's so quiet over there from the shorts it's unbelievable. Simple fact: 36% is nothing. It can be won back in six months to a year of solid gains. But first, the bleeding has to stop. That doesn't happen until the two magic words are heard: MAX PAIN!!!!!!! We're probably 50-100 points from that. Or we already be there. All you can do if your long is wait it out.</Msg><Username>groovenirvana2013</Username><Timestamp>1362458427134</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:40:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362458452036-4458</Id><Topic><Title>Apple going down</Title><Username>kevinmhowell</Username><Timestamp>1362457846022</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:30:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How intelligent... nothing to say about fundamentals of course... only one motive..</Msg><Username>porchoggs</Username><Timestamp>1362458452036</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:40:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362458454601-4459</Id><Topic><Title>I will buy a dollar bill with 80 cents, buying up AAPL with cash</Title><Username>king_kim_1</Username><Timestamp>1362457986484</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-03-04 23:33:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Calling Tim Cook tomorrow, he may have unique answer.
