Piper mentions Google Glass and how eman might benefit. eman on 8% on this news. zero "Emerging applications in military and consumer devices as well as disruptive technologies such as Google glass position eMagin for revenue and earnings upside over the next 12-24 months." eMagin (EMAN) Overweight Early Mover in OLED Microdisplays; Initiating at OW with $6 PT C O N C L U S I O N We are initiating coverage on eMagin, an early mover in OLED microdisplays, with an Overweight rating and a $6 price target. Microdisplays are small, near-to-eye displays that are typically less than 1 inch diagonal with high resolution images that require optical magnification. Our investment thesis is based on the following: 1) eMagin growing its revenues at least 20% y/y for the next two years given the backdrop of secular industry growth and share gains against LCD microdisplays; 2) Leverage in the operating model that is likely to unfold on rising revenues which translates into 1500bps of operating margin improvement by 2014; and 3) Emerging applications in military and consumer devices as well as disruptive technologies such as Google glass position eMagin for revenue and earnings upside over the next 12-24 months. Our $6 PT is based on 12x our CY14E proforma EPS estimate of $0.50. • Well-positioned in the growing microdisplay sector. The overall OLED microdisplay market is expected to grow from ~$140m in CY11 to $200m by CY14. As the market opportunity evolves with military leading the way followed by select commercial, and industrial applications, we see eMagin's revenues growing at least 20% for the next two years given 500bps of share gains from LCD based microdisplays. We remain bullish on eMagin's microdisplay prospects as they havekey benefits over LCD-based microdisplays such as light weight, low power, better image quality, etc. • Expect operating margin leverage to unfold. As eMagin ramps capacity with its new deposition tool and its proprietary processes, we believe the company will likely benefit from improving yields and productivity. We expect gross margins to increase by 500bps over the next two years to ~55%. Given the increasing revenue trajectory as most of the fixed costs are already addressed, we see overall op. margins expanding 1500 bps to 23.5% by 2014 from 8.3% in 2012 as opex as % of revenue declines from 2012 to 2014. • Likely beneficiary of emerging applications. We view the electronic view finder (EVF) in high end digital cameras as an immediate opportunity which could grow to $100- $150m over the next three years. Over the next three years we see the company likely benefiting from adoption in avionics, consumer gaming &amp; entertainment, and disruptive technologies such as Google glass type applications. We think three segments could offer eMagin a potential addressable market of $1bn by 2015. • Initiate at OW, $6 PT. The peer group trades in a range of 6x-13x CY14E EPS. We assign a 12x multiple to CY14 proforma EPS of $0.50 to arrive at our $6 PT.</Msg><Username>zeroletdown</Username><Timestamp>1350057073394</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 11:51:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350059750259-38</Id><Title>Surprise Jack Welch Missed Shows Better U.S. Growth: Economy</Title><Msg>Surprise Jack Welch Missed Shows Better U.S. Growth: Economy By Shobhana Chandra and Mike Dorning - Oct 12, 2012 9:46 AM CT Bloomberg: It isn’t only the federal government’s Bureau of Labor Statistics that is issuing surprisingly good news about the U.S. economy these days. If former General Electric Co. Chief Executive Officer Jack Welch’s charges of a political fix to manipulate economic data ahead of the presidential election are true, there must be a vast econometric conspiracy embracing auto dealers, real estate agents, the Federal Reserve and corporate America’s 96-year-old Conference Board. The economy is improving more than professional forecasters anticipated, particularly in data on employment and housing, according to the Bloomberg Economic Surprise Index, which compares 38 indicators with analysts’ predictions. The index, based on gauges compiled by private businesses and trade groups in addition to government, confirms U.S. growth is generating jobs in the face of a global slowdown and looming federal spending cuts and tax increases known as the fiscal cliff.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy</Username><Timestamp>1350059750259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:35:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350059902609-39</Id><Title>another mobile ads story mentioning goog fb and velt</Title><Msg>this is the future in advertising</Msg><Username>shavitmi</Username><Timestamp>1350059902609</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:38:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350059902673-40</Id><Title>another mobile ads story mentioning goog fb and velt</Title><Msg>this is the future in advertising</Msg><Username>shavitmi</Username><Timestamp>1350059902673</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 12:38:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350060406379-41</Id><Title>Volume is so low</Title><Msg>How does anyone make money on this?

At the heart of the ranking process is 'clicks'; more clicks means that website is more relevant than others. [It seems like a trivial detail right now, but we'll get back to that. It'll matter in a moment] It's a technology that Lycos (yes, the nearly-dead search engine organization) bought and employed. Between then and, oh, 2002 or so, the search engine industry basically died. Why? There was no money in it. One of the few remaining players in the business was Yahoo! (NASDAQ:YHOO), which dominated at the time, and a cute little project named Google, which wasn't expected to last much longer.... at the time. (And yes, this all does have to do with Vringo right now - hang on a sec.) In fact, Yahoo! (via Overture, which it bought through an acquisition) went on to file more patents for a method to place ads on a search engine's results page. Not all of Yahoo!'s requested patents were approved though, because - wait for it - Ken Lang had already filed (and won) for the other patents Yahoo! was looking to win approval for. If it seems vaguely familiar, it may be because Google ended up settling with Yahoo! in 2004, out of court, for a license to use Yahoo!'s patented ad-bidding system. [Keep that detail in your back pocket too.] This was right around the time Google was going public, but more important, this was also around the time Google's business started to explode. Revenues soared from $3.2 billion in 2004 to last year's $37.9 billion, shortly after its search engine market share soared from 2002's 29% to today's 70% or so. Great, but what does any of this have to do with Vringo now? Vringo contends that the reason - and we can infer Vringo is contending it's the only reason - Google has become a smashing success is because Google used Vringo's patented process for creating the search engine's clearly valuable relevance ranking system (i.e. that's how Google became the top name in search) and ad-display process, and as a result, Vringo's patent is the reason Google has grown so rapidly. See, Vringo now owns the patents that Ken Lang filed... the same patents that Lycos bought from Ken Lang, the same patents that Lycos sold to a company called Innovate/Protect a few months ago, and the same patents that Vringo owns now through its recent merger with Innovate/Protect. More important, if Google really did use a Vringo-owned patented process the whole time it was becoming a search engine giant, then it owes Vringo a truckload of money, for lost royalties. Moreover, if Google knowingly used a process patented by someone else, it also owes damages.... to the tune of billions of dollars.
