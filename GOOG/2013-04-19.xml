Late Thursday, the Obama administration reiterated that cybersecurity is a top priority and said it would work with both parties to build on the House legislation and get a bill through the Senate. "While CISPA has been improved in each of the administration's priority areas since its introduction this year, the bill does not yet adequately address our fundamental concerns," said Laura Lucas, a spokeswoman for the White House's National Security Council. "We are hopeful that continued bipartisan, bicameral collaboration to incorporate our core priorities will produce cybersecurity legislation that addresses these critical issues and that the president can sign into law." Industry groups that supported the measure welcomed the House's action. Backers included the wireless group CTIA, the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and TechNet, which represents big technology companies such as Google Inc, Apple Inc, Yahoo! Inc and Cisco Systems Inc.</Msg><Username>amishelviss</Username><Timestamp>1366365833151</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 06:03:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366368933897-8</Id><Title>OMG...

It doesn't mean up or down, left or right, or diagonally. Especially when the stock randomly drops 20 points on the day of earnings. That just means it wasn't sitting in the right place to begin with. Cost per click, in EVERY study I've read, is supposed to go up. You're probably comparing it to a holiday quarter where advertising budgets are through the roof.... Motorola is a drain....right now. No one is arguing that. However, its potential far outweighs this current "restructuring" period its going through. Look at the popularity of googles nexus line based solely on the fact that its PURE ANDROID. People love it, and will gobble up googles hardware for potential hundreds of billions of net worth. Tax paid..the QE is on going. Less tax, means more RandD, and more expansion.

Apple is losing market share every quarter. Their ancient phones look like flip phones to android users. Thats why apple got crushed.

Google on the other hand...has chromebooks, office competitor(drive) and the cloud, google fiber, google cars, google glass, google maps, google books(translations and digitizing), YOUTUBE.

It pigeonholed itself into a market that was eventually going to be saturated. They have nothing in the pipeline that will help them out of the mess they are in. They thought their patents would save them, but thats not the case. Apple is dead. The amount of cash they have on hand will ensure its a lengthy drawn out death, but its comparable to someone having a fatal disease... Google on the other hand has made incredibly good strategic decisions for cementing their future prospects. I named a few already. Advertising is always going to be a big business, and google isn't waiting for advertisers, they are creating new advertising marketplaces. Do you realize how powerful that is? Cost per click, again, is down compared to what? The holiday season? In general, its supposed to go up, what happens in one quarter is pointless. Google is continously making strides in mobile to ensure relevant content. Mobile cpc is going to jump, especially since penetration is continue to rise. Again, whether they missed their numbers or not..who cares. They made a ton of money, and did so while spending a ton, and setting up many amazing long term investments. Google wins. everything.</Msg><Username>dinkyrpg</Username><Timestamp>1366396670012</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:37:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366396706249-149</Id><Title>Going to $810 EOD</Title><Msg>Yes sir!!!</Msg><Username>dslmantl</Username><Timestamp>1366396706249</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:38:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366396753607-150</Id><Topic><Title>Remember the top upgrade is $1,100.00!!!</Title><Username>kingcuffs</Username><Timestamp>1366396085011</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:28:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sooner than you think!</Msg><Username>biobum</Username><Timestamp>1366396753607</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 14:39:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366397044907-151</Id><Title>Google and Apple were same price just 6 months ago..</Title><Msg>Now google is over twice as expensive.

But more tech savvy people own Adroids, so, for instance, they don't pay for music. Apple fans are fairly ignorant technically...which is why they have iphones. The mainstream media is roughly 1-2 years behind the tech heads. That gives apple about 1.5 years to find themselves and prove the tech heads that their phone isn't an obsolete paperweight. If they are unable to win back over some tech heads (outside of Cnet sigh), the uneducated rich iphone folks will jump ship as well and start buying google.

Facebook relies far too heavily on its massive amount of traffic and doesn't have the infrastructure in place to survive once that traffic dries up (It already is!) Google on the otherhand, built Google+ as a tool to supplement all its other offerings. It automatically loads all my pictures into it, I pick and choose what I want to put out there. Either way, its stored for me...automatically. Gmail, hangouts, youtube, google play, etc. They are learning far more than facebook could by creating your digital persona through services that YOU REQUIRE in day to day activities. Apple is not a competitor to google anymore. They are wiped out. MS is the next target with Google Chromebooks and Google Drive. Twitter and Pandora? Not following that one. but even so, they don't pose a threat. I agree no growth goes on forever. Unless you plan for it. Google is the one company that I would ever acknowledge as being adaptable. They haven't trapped themselves in any one area. They are always on the cutting edge and constantly adapting their core principals.
