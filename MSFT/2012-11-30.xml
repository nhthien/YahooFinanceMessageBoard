I'm not sure why anyone would pay the premium for an iPad over a Kindle much less a Surface, but a Surface strikes me as a replacement for laptops and that's where I am interested. When the PRO comes out regardless of whether it is a great product or not I will be getting one and I will let you know what I think of it. I own Apple products and they are fine, but I work in an environment where MS OS's and MS Office are the norms. I am looking to replace laptops with Surface tablets. I was going to buy an RT to test, but the price point was too high for a throwaway. The RT price made me figure they were really going to go over the top with the Pro prices. I like the PRO price point. That's the point. If the Surface fails, that's fine with me. I just want to own a system compatible with everything else I work with. I follow the stock, but don't currently have a position in it. Full disclosure: I have owned the stock, shorted the stock, and held call and puts on it.</Msg><Username>loungeact131</Username><Timestamp>1354254494430</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 00:48:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354257608612-3</Id><Topic><Title>Surface Pro - Starting at $899</Title><Username>loungeact131</Username><Timestamp>1354212567835</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-11-29 13:09:27 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You're just another shill ID on Yahoo.

The percentage of whites and blacks on welfare is almost equal, despite the fact that the income of working blacks is much lower than those of working whites. Hispanics have a much lower percentage on both welfare and out of wedlock kids. The fastest growing rate of children born to unwed moms is among white college dropout women. And for your racist information, welfare benefits are highest in Hawaii and Alaska - where the black population is minuscule - but where Bristol Palin is the poster child for the fastest growing sector of unwed mothers. Sarah's hypocricy knows no bounds - her state leads the nation in per-capita welfare payments. She may not be able to see Putin from there, but she was a pro at reaching into the pockets of the rest of us. Mitch McConnell and Rand Paul represent one of the states highest on the Federal pap suck.

The only "governments" who want them are state governments. If you think a black community organizer from Chicago gives a crap about the price of corn and pork bellies, that's crazy. Oil industry kickbacks are to get them to drill for oil in speculative regions - or is supposed to be. Under Republicans, for years, just more ways to get campaign contributions. When Obama couldn't get the House to cut them, he smartly put their leases on a "use it or lose it" basis - and boom, we got more new wells drilled in 4 years under Obama than 8 years under Bush - which is partly why this nation is well on its way to oil independence. Look at the states with the greatest percentage of long term unemployed. They're easy to spot - they're RED. Personally, I'd love to see the states trying to secede actually do so.. Our blue-state taxes would drop dramatically, and our chat rooms would be a lot more intellectual.</Msg><Username>ct_digital_photog</Username><Timestamp>1354272204253</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 05:43:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354277644226-10</Id><Title>FREE w8 pro pack</Title><Msg>Add Windows 8 Pro Pack or Windows 8 Media Center Pack to your edition of Windows, a $69 value FREE until Jan 31.

Here's betting they're working like crazy to get the battery life up beyond the 3-1/2-4 hours ("half that of the Surface RT") as cited on the MSFT corporate blog. They can't afford to bring it market and have it slaughtered - not after spending $9.8 billion in R&amp;D on the Surface and Windows 8 during 2012. That short a battery life kills it for enterprise tablet use. Bet they're also struggling to shrink the size of the OS. I own a 64GB iPad, about 4GB of which is iOS and base apps. Argue that it's not a "real" enterprise OS if you want, but frankly, the C-suites and sales managers who will make the purchase decisions won't care what IT thinks.</Msg><Username>ct_digital_photog</Username><Timestamp>1354288981783</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 10:23:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354289194776-46</Id><Topic><Title>SURFACE= ZUNE= PINK PROJECT. 99% WILL CHOOSE AN IPAD/MAC AIR.

Additionally the Great Society programs especially Medicare, Medicaide, the Civil Rights and Voting rights legislation and Obama Care. Why- one reason is the Puritanical notion that these kinds of modern societal aides are sinful and bad for ones personal character. Another major motive is the notion that the economy cannot support medical care for all the citizens of the society and that the poorest must be left to suffer with their diseases and die an early death in destitution. The billionaires who fund their front organizations such as Americans for Prosperity etc etc appear to want no less than to establish some sort of American Oligarchy to replace the current government with. Never mind that there would likely be a bloody war for dominance among them where even Charlie and his brother David Koch would be at each others throats to get the top Oligarch job. But worst of all would be the effects on the US citizenry where the USA would be reduced to some wretched society resembling Czarist Russia during Doesteyvsky's time. These goals which are supported by the many RWNJ nostrums for this country drive these mental midgets to cause the rest of us so much heartburn.</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1354291399683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 11:03:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354291460825-53</Id><Title>What does it tell you when MSFT is down 1% ?</Title><Msg>Only that the markets are open that day.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1354291460825</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 11:04:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354291484660-54</Id><Topic><Title>Alfred E.

You also have millions of in field techs repairing machines that carry laptops now. You have millions of insurance adjusters, police, utility workers etc. that would benifit from a secure powerful lightweight machine. Anyone that thinks an ipad will be attractive when there is a machine the same size and weight that can run "ANY PROGRAM" is kidding themselves. Ipads will be good for sitting in Starbucks and trying to look trendy if you are 19. Real business can be done on the surface. Ipads are trendy "NOW". When something new comes out that makes something that is currently trendy look really "out of date", there are always people who just "don't get it" until everyone else gets it. When people see what others can do on a Surface than there Ipad seems so 2010. Surface is the next step forward.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1354296492525</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 12:28:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354296653652-73</Id><Title>It's scary that MSFT is being heavily shorted at..</Title><Msg>..basically 52 week lows.

Simple MSFT owns about 90% of the OS market with Win 8 being unliked by many there will be no one upgrading just people who buy new PC's. Win 7 will be the choice for a few years as far as businesses users so unless they buy new computers that's it no new sells. When XP came out people upgraded OS's because it was worth it, no upgrades this time around except a small niche crowd who has to be on the cutting edge of everything.</Msg><Username>creephhi</Username><Timestamp>1354297741027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 12:49:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354297767254-77</Id><Title>2.37 holiday dividend coming.</Title><Msg>nice.</Msg><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1354297767254</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 12:49:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354297778020-78</Id><Title>Friday yet heavier selling volume!</Title><Msg>Folks either wanting out or shorting?

To make it perfectly clear, despite having nearly 100% of the smartphone and tablet market, as well as nearly the entirety of the microcontroller and embedded space, ARM fails to generate net income that comes out to even a fraction of that of its licensees and peers in the semiconductor industry. The company's initial success in the mobile computing markets has been primarily due to the firm's long-standing focus on the low power/embedded space, which allowed its products to evolve, due primarily to process technology advancements, to become fast enough to enable smartphones and tablets. The low power, low ASP application processor segment was largely overlooked by larger competitors early on, which gave ARM and its licensees the spotlight in the mobile processor world. However, going forward, it is clear that the actual ARM core designs will become less important, and that ARM's primary role in the mobile world will be as an instruction set licensee, given that there is now a substantial software base for the firm's instruction set in place. No other company could reasonably hope to compete in designing its own instruction set (other than Intel and its already established X86 ISA) since the software support and toolset -- usually the product of many years of development -- would be an almost intractable barrier to overcome. In short, ARM's business model will generate consistent, but low amounts of revenue and net income compared to its peers, which means that it is very unlikely that it will ever grow the top and bottom lines enough to warrant its valuation. However, the stock has seen an extraordinary run post-earnings and even more recently over the last couple of days. The earnings report was nothing to write home about -- it beat analyst revenue forecasts by $2M (for a total quarterly sales figure of $227M) , and as a result, the company has gained over $4B in market capitalization.</Msg><Username>roor15</Username><Timestamp>1354303743115</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 14:29:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354303893934-117</Id><Topic><Title>Why Apple should buy MSFT...</Title><Username>a_littleguy</Username><Timestamp>1354280966869</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 08:09:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It would be a fitting end for this pig.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1354303893934</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 14:31:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354303957282-118</Id><Topic><Title>If it drops horde it-25.50</Title><Username>ddeboy</Username><Timestamp>1354283269606</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 08:47:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>How about the last 12 years, is that long enough? - lol.</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1354303957282</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 14:32:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354303989397-119</Id><Topic><Title>what s wrong with msft its been going down our life time savings on red line</Title><Username>dal9591</Username><Timestamp>1354300158257</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 13:29:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are too stupid to reply to the correct poster, who's fault is that?</Msg><Username>predisposable_nym_01</Username><Timestamp>1354303989397</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 14:33:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354304002848-120</Id><Topic><Title>Gigantic Update for Microsoft Corporation.

Next year is do-or-die for Microsoft, RIM in smartphone OS market IDC says growth in smart mobile device spending to spur IT spending uptick November 29, 2012 | By Fred Donovan IT spending on smart mobile devices--smartphones, tablet and eReaders--will increase 20 percent next year, making up 57 percent of the growth in overall IT spending for the year, according to estimates by research firm IDC. Worldwide IT spending is expected to grow at a more modest 5.7 percent, exceeding $2.1 trillion in 2013, according to IDC. In 2013, Microsoft (NASDAQ: MSFT) and Research in Motion (NASDAQ: RIMM) will need to capture greater interest from mobile app developers to expand the number of apps that run on devices powered by their respective operating systems. Failure to do so by the end of 2013 will likely be the beginning of their demise in this market, IDC cautioned.</Msg><Username>hcram906130</Username><Timestamp>1354305971257</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 15:06:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354305989940-144</Id><Topic><Title>Grabbed 100 shares at 26.87 yesterday and 100 today at 26.51... nice...</Title><Username>yourwishismine</Username><Timestamp>1354300294678</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 13:31:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"...REAL soon."</Msg><Username>mikerego19</Username><Timestamp>1354305989940</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 15:06:29 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354306258116-145</Id><Title>somebody please kick balmer in the nuts...</Title><Msg>why is this IDIOT still CEO?

The problem is not tablets cannibalization of laptops, its rather the fear of it. iPad is a category in itself .. and people who own iPads tend own Mac as well, NOT not buy laptops.... but removing this gap between these two categories is cannibalization in itself ... and the fear self fulfilled. More Macs are sold because of Apple brand on laptops resulting in reducion of PC laptop sales, coupled with louzy bulky and power hungry laptops that char anyones thighs. iPad acted as a great marketing device for Apple to up its Mac brand. There was no real cannibalization of PC directly by iPads rather it was a switch to Macs from PCs. Now with the gap between tablets and laptops gone, the perceived cannibalization is now a reality, and will MSFT gain from such a cannibal approach? INTC is at fault here big time. Had they not required to put a fan on all tablets, they'd have possibly succeded in retaining the wintel duopoly. The rise of AAPL and GOOG is truely capitalism and free market in play. It should be so. MSFT has the talent but does not want to (STILL) use it. Why do people start seeing light only before they die? MSFT still does not see the light.

They should be putting fear in voters minds regarding socialism, and take on Obama when he lies putting fear in voters minds. And it isn't hard to do. Compare what is going on in Europe with what will happen here at home. Put fear in everyday workers minds as to who will pay the tax raises Obama says will be on the rich. There are many topics to discredit socialist Obama, and Romney was unwilling to do it just as McCain said he didn't want to do it. Fear is the only thing stupid libdems understand as evidenced by what Carville said about you libs. And he was the main Democrat Operative during Clinton's re-election. But then again there are folks that say I am wrong. That libs are so stupid not even fear works. It has to get down to where they will feel the pain, and that is coming to your area very soon.</Msg><Username>doublehaul32</Username><Timestamp>1354319266216</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 18:47:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354320493608-185</Id><Topic><Title>Kill Off The Windows RT Tablet - Nobody Is Buying Anway</Title><Username>sanddollars586</Username><Timestamp>1354318260937</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 18:31:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The Samsung ATIV 500T tablet is back in stock at Amazon.
