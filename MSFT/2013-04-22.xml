Microsoft Windows 8 software was up substantially. The figures are public even to bashers like you. The stores upgraded all existing Windows 7 pc's to W8 with software upgrades. I questioned: Walmart, Staples, Best Buy &amp; Sams Club. I thought this was odd behavior because the sales of thos pc's would not be counted as Windows 8 PC's but Windows 7. I was also curious if they were doing it properly by using a separate license for each machine or taking one Windows 8 disk and upgrading them. I think that is a job for Microsoft not myself to investigate. I believe if you go into Walmart you will find that some lazy store worker used the same disk to upgrade 5-10 old W7 machines to Windows 8 upgrade packages. Microsoft may have given them permission but the same disk is a little shaky. The 2 billion investment by Value... is proof that they understand that slow PC's was simply an upgrade via software which was substantial. Perhaps you can use facts in your rebuttal rather than meaningless rants.</Msg><Username>msftstockmachine</Username><Timestamp>1366640113642</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 10:15:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366640252575-27</Id><Title>MSFT is also taking business away from IBM....</Title><Msg>The big Blue is going to get killed by the Windows Blue....

But given the daily RSI is already over 70 and is forming a bearish divergence, short term pullback is inevitable. If you have already owned shares, it is a good idea to sell some covered calls. If you don't own shares or want to add more, you can sell short term ATM puts or just buy on pullback.</Msg><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1366655817350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:36:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366655945539-134</Id><Title>For all you AAPL backers, I would buy BIDU ahead of AAPL at their current valuation levels...</Title><Msg>BIDU is a SOLID buy at current valuation levels.</Msg><Username>dbehr25</Username><Timestamp>1366655945539</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:39:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366656589794-135</Id><Topic><Title>Someone is going to lose big over the long term and isn't shorts.</Title><Username>sellstrengthshort</Username><Timestamp>1366644537580</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 11:28:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Surface pun intended?</Msg><Username>dbehr25</Username><Timestamp>1366656589794</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:49:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366656734800-136</Id><Topic><Title>50 MA and 200 MA are about to cross over each other to form the golden cross</Title><Username>pureinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1366655817350</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:36:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>U don't know what a transversal filter is, why comment??</Msg><Username>cfuryurself</Username><Timestamp>1366656734800</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:52:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366656822900-137</Id><Topic><Title>Let's Celebrate Earth Day Today</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1366656249806</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 14:44:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes lets celebrate by pointing out isolated kooks as thought they stand for the consensus.

Plus, Apple contracts out all fabrication, so it's not even a hardware company, it's a design company. That's fine if you have unique designs (iPhone 4 years ago), but Apple's design are not unique today. It takes months for Apple to make and ship a few million phones. It takes Microsoft literally two seconds to manufacture and ship a few million copies of Office. That's the difference. The economics of software manufacture vs hardware manufacture. Apple's margins are contracting. Volume is ok, but margins (profit per phone), is falling, and will continue to fall. No slam on Apple - they made billions in recent years, but the business model does have a weakness - it requires continued innovation, and great innovative products are not something you can count on producing year after year.</Msg><Username>clcellve</Username><Timestamp>1366662954249</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 16:35:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366663078413-175</Id><Topic><Title>Finally this stock gets the #$%$ pop it deserves!</Title><Username>dbehr25</Username><Timestamp>1366403065798</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-19 16:24:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yup. that called non sequitur. glad you understand and teach other reader about that! maybe soon you get tenure, or man...</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1366663078413</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 16:37:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366663107823-176</Id><Topic><Title>sold all my msft today...</Title><Username>zbgb952</Username><Timestamp>1366652040074</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-04-22 13:34:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If Windows 8 takes off like it could, MSFT will do very well.
