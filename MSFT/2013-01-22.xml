A solid, record earnings report on Thursday 24th: Record revenues, Record Profits, Record cash flow. MSFT already said 60Million widows8 sold and that is on top of the ongoing windows7 refresh/upgrade cycle in enterprises. Micrsoft likely sold 1million Surface RT grabbing 5% marketshare of AppleiPad in 2months. Office, Servers, Xbox, Halo, Bing all had solid quarter based data I have seen from industry channel reports 2. Surfce Pro launch next week: I expect Micrsooft will sell between 10Million to 20million Surface Pros in 2013. At an ASP of about $1,000 it will result in $10Billion to $20Billion in additional revenue in 2013. 3. Office2013, Sql and server 2013 as well as the Windows8 at $100 ASP/license (starting Feb 1st) means solid growth I expect about $3.30 forward earnings with a PE of 10 to 13. The stock in my view will rally to 33 soon and then to 42 as the street appreciates the growth prospect. Note: Windows phone is growing 400% year overyearand in some European coutries ishitting 20% marketshare. Microsoft also gets about 1Billion per year android Patent fees and it is growing. New Xbox (720?) will likelybe talked about Feb first week 23c dividend comes in Feb.

Microsoft dismissed the reports in public and repeatedly emphasized that Project Natal would be fully compatible with all Xbox 360 consoles. Microsoft indicated that the company considers it to be a significant initiative, as fundamental to the Xbox brand as Xbox Live,[55] and with a launch akin to that of a new Xbox console platform.[56] Kinect was even referred to as a "new Xbox" by Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer at a speech for the Executives' Club of Chicago.[57][58] When asked if the introduction will extend the time before the next-generation console platform is launched (historically about 5 years between platforms),[59] Microsoft corpora"</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1358867711328</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:15:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358867917104-18</Id><Topic><Title>3 major innovations with msft</Title><Username>cameleonman</Username><Timestamp>1358866459124</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 09:54:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>M$FT developed Kinect entirely from begining to end, Thank You Steve Ballmer!</Msg><Username>williamdavis960</Username><Timestamp>1358867917104</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:18:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358868047786-19</Id><Topic><Title>Another Fine American Bolting from Kookville</Title><Username>plmartintexas2012</Username><Timestamp>1358867027007</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:03:47 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"federal and you look at the disability and the unemployment and the Social Security " The biggest kookville state is Texas.

I have been long on MSFT since the 80's. The Windows 8 experience has been the single most enjoyable time in my life in using computers and phones. Change never comes easy and you can never please everyone. I even understand the Silverlight change even though I loved that code in pure Silverlight. The win 8 phone and win 8 needed the change. A lot of innovation has come lately with a tablet that has full pc power and live tiles on a Nokia phone that works better than any phone on the market. Nokia was the right decision and is creating a shakeup.</Msg><Username>likinnok</Username><Timestamp>1358868921068</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:35:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358869039154-22</Id><Title>pl moe rooon forgets he would have to ride in the back of the bus but for loiberals</Title><Msg>you need to build a fire under your shrink moe rooon he sure isn't helping you one bit your more psychotic now than you were a year ago</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1358869039154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:37:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358869091406-23</Id><Topic><Title>pl moe rooon forgets he would have to ride in the back of the bus but for loiberals</Title><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1358869039154</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:37:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>that's liberals - not loiberals</Msg><Username>father_zosima</Username><Timestamp>1358869091406</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:38:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358869281634-24</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT on the up swing Windows 8 now in phones , tablets and new P/C also all the upgrades, People really like windows 8 server GOOD job MSFT</Title><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358827009898</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-01-21 22:56:49 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>MSFT starting to move higher, Time to get the MSFT bus and take the ride higher</Msg><Username>coinmaker77</Username><Timestamp>1358869281634</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:41:21 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358869440221-25</Id><Topic><Title>MSFT Upgraded to STRONG BUY (EXCLUSIVE REPORT)</Title><Username>adammedlin953</Username><Timestamp>1358459471099</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-17 16:51:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report, thanks</Msg><Username>benjaminmartin945</Username><Timestamp>1358869440221</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 10:44:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1358869968687-26</Id><Title>What happened to all the people that didn't like windows 8, They found out how to use it and now love it.

Like I said before, the price of w8 increased to $200/copy has multiple purposes (monopoly and getting the competitors to pay as much as they can get). Get it while it is dirt cheap, this supertanker is turning the course.

Really? Gosh it seems to me that this stock has had no problem whatsoever languishing where it is right now for a dozen years or so, in spite of all the hype and bloviation you pathetic pumpers and shills have engaged in during that period. Perhaps if MS would hire some *competent* shills that knew how to pump with the truth as opposed to the kinds of LIES that *YOU* tell, it might actually be possible to fool a few marks into signing on for this garbage.

No pain for them, and a me first character, a macho character too, makes them immune. It's very simple, take away assault weapons and not allow them, no one wil be killed after with them. It's so very clear, when a gun loving mother has a son who kills her and children like he did. There are lots of kids like that, often picked on by bullies, you know the kind of people, the gun nuts often are bullies as well. If you have guns in your home, the kid hiding his anger will find them and some of those kids will continue to mass murder. There is no defense to not taking away all assault weaponry..</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1358891266926</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-22 16:47:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1358891388927-79</Id><Topic><Title>N R.

The company largely buys itself. But Dell already has a debt-to-equity ratio of 88. The last thing a box-maker needs is a lot of debt. If there is a plan to reduce debt at a new IPO a few years from now, that would be interesting. But the idea of taking Dell private is a strategy of PC's rebounding a few years from now.
