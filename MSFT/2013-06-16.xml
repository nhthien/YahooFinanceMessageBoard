Microsoft management used to understand that Microsoft needs its community of independent developers more than they need Microsoft. If management no longer understands that, well, that is just one more sign that Microsoft is being seriously mismanaged.</Msg><Username>trollers_nightmare</Username><Timestamp>1371356357683</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 00:19:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371356762764-3</Id><Title>JUST AS THE SP.

The "study" purported H.Q. to be from Alabama actually has a Washington D.C. call back number. Because of ND contracts they cannot reveal the actual study or who funded it. Now, gullible Obama bois, try to think for a minute, how would one survey watched network AND learn that viewers actual I,Q.?????? Well I just sold a pile of real estate so I sent $50K to a research/detective firm in D.C. which found it was not actually Fox viewers tallied but how Obama supporters PERCEIVED Fox viewers. Further, since I was paying for an investigation and a new survey it was discovered that Fox viewers actually had an I.Q. of 104 4% above national average. An additional question found that 69% of those who support Obama found lying an acceptable vehicle to the end of agenda advancement. 62% realize Obama lies with some regularity. 65% want recent scandals swept under the rug so that the welfare checks can continue. The last two questions were the killers though, my study found 22% of Obama supporters were unemployed, almost three times the official national average and of those unemployed Obama defenders the average I.Q. was 87. My study is real and scientifically done, trust me, gullible morons.</Msg><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1371379273508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 06:41:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>11</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371383572764-15</Id><Topic><Title>Bestselling Laptop</Title><Username>papa.weelee</Username><Timestamp>1371288268007</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 05:24:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Amazon's #1 bestselling laptop is the Samsung running Windows 8, IE 10 and Microsoft Office.

Published two months ago. Quoting: "At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market", Bob O'Donnell, IDC vice president, says. Holy Moley, Windows 8 slowed the market? You want to know why Ballmer booted Sinfosky out the door? O'Donnell offers chilling indictment. "While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices", he says. "Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market".</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1371385910164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 08:31:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371385989833-19</Id><Title>Exclusive Games - XBox One leads PS4 2 to 1</Title><Msg>Why do gamers buy a box? To play games of course. With XBox One having twice as many exclusive games, you have to figure in the end that alone will lead to XBox One dominating the market. And with MSFT's moves to appease developers, I think Mister Softy's lead in the exclusive game category will grow, leaving Sony and PS4 in the dust. I understand the knee jerk reaction of the market is to favor PS4 over XBox One due to restrictions MSFT has put in place... But in the end there is NOTHING more restrictive than not having the best games to play. And that is one restriction PS4 will likely never be able to overcome versus XBox One. With the undisputed lead in exclusive games, MSFT put restrictions in place because they can. When push comes to shove, I think most gamers will want the box with the best games. That will be XBox One all the way.</Msg><Username>oncmillionaire</Username><Timestamp>1371385989833</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 08:33:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371387049743-20</Id><Topic><Title>Windows will be the Apple Smasher!</Title><Username>travisthechimp.alsharpton</Username><Timestamp>1371360954899</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 01:35:54 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Huh?

Not too sure what that means, if you are suggesting thinking faster than accurate touch typing indicates a lower I.Q?... actually the opposite is true. And if you were selecting me as an example, I seldom watch Fox, I watch Brian Williams because I want to know what the enemies of America are saying. Then from time to time Lester Holt substitutes for Williams and is far more fair and a better anchor and NBC just gives news but I can count on Williams to slant it far left. Besides as to low I.Q.

Published two months ago. Quoting: "At this point, unfortunately, it seems clear that the Windows 8 launch not only failed to provide a positive boost to the PC market, but appears to have slowed the market", Bob O'Donnell, IDC vice president, says. Holy Moley, Windows 8 slowed the market? You want to know why Ballmer booted Sinfosky out the door? O'Donnell offers chilling indictment. "While some consumers appreciate the new form factors and touch capabilities of Windows 8, the radical changes to the UI, removal of the familiar Start button, and the costs associated with touch have made PCs a less attractive alternative to dedicated tablets and other competitive devices", he says. "Microsoft will have to make some very tough decisions moving forward if it wants to help reinvigorate the PC market".

"Some argue that the spread of these weapons cannot be stopped, cannot be checked," actor Robert De Niro says in the video. "Such fatalism is a deadly adversary," Damon responds. Whoopi Goldberg, Morgan Freeman, Naomi Watts and Christoph Waltz also appear in the two-and-a-half minute spot. The video was produced by Global Zero, a Washington, D.C.-based grassroots organization whose mission is "to eliminate all nuclear weapons by 2030." “The message from national security experts and citizens around the world is clear: the only way to eliminate the global nuclear danger is to eliminate all nuclear weapons,” Michael Douglas says. “It's time to set the world's course to zero.” To do so, Global Zero said in a press release, President Obama "will have to go beyond the bilateral process President Reagan started of U.S.-Soviet/Russian arms reductions and bring the other leading nuclear powers into international arms negotiations for the first time in history." The group also sent an open letter to Obama recalling a 2009 speech in which the president committed to their cause.</Msg><Username>ossobucco2112</Username><Timestamp>1371407149736</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 14:25:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371407757788-82</Id><Topic><Title>Do a little "study" on the research that dound Fox vierers with lower I.Q.s</Title><Username>an_obama_nation</Username><Timestamp>1371379273508</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 06:41:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Is that what you dound. that spelling or typo's or reverse amortization formulas are the sign of smarts...

Both generate income.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371418883625</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 17:41:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1371419012811-159</Id><Title>Samsung analysts ask hard questions as S4 marketing charm wears off....</Title><Msg>Folks the analysts have reduced the S4 volume by 30% as WP_8 is going to kill Android and iPhone on the high end and start developing the lower end with Lumia 521....

Sony does not come with motion sensing. That is extra. Microsoft has HD Skype. Microsoft has W8 interface style and web searching in a split screen. Microsoft has exclusive content from Stephen Spielberg &amp; NFL. Microsoft has XBOX music, movies and facial recognition. Microsoft has social networking that allows a user to see if their friends are on line and what they are playing. Microsoft has a blu ray player. Microsoft senses weight, heart rate and the slightest wrist movement wirelessly. The heart rate &amp; weight is going to produce some pretty amazing workout apps I believe. Microsoft will allow Windows 8 apps to run and have connectivity via Nokia phones or it may be Microsoft Surface Phone then. There is no comparison and the XBOX ONE will be the hot item this Christmas. It will be the item they are fighting over on Black Friday.</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1371419404456</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 17:50:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371419448283-166</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung analysts ask hard questions as S4 marketing charm wears off....</Title><Username>ossobucco2012</Username><Timestamp>1371419012811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-06-16 17:43:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No bing is hype the numbers by virus attacks through ie-10 and os 8 and all know it...

The Stephen Spielberg looks pretty impressive and I am not into that at all. Seeing the experience and how it makes you feel like you are there was interesting anyway. The NFL experience is the big one. Every football fan will get this. Where I live, you have to pay the cable people extra to see the home team. You have to get a NFL package if you want all the games. Microsoft nailed it with the NFL exclusive. That will sell the hell out of this plus the massive demand by gamers.
