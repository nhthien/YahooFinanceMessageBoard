I hate msft for being so unoriginal and love msft for catching up eventually. msft never had an original products in its entire existence, but it always manage to catch up and surpass. Now steve jobs is gone, it is time for msft to catch up. if I am not wrong, I think msft is ready to dominate again for PCs (or Tablets this time around). Windows 8 is a winner, no matter how you slice it or dice it. Live tiles are a great branding and functional win for microsoft. Just base on that infrastructure, Apple looks old and gasping for new ideas. The fact that Windows 8 sold better than expected, you know that MSFT is coming back to dominate. However, its stock performance always gets to low 30s and then punks back down to mid 20s. every f#$# year. But ... now we have more cash in the market (thanks to Fed printing $$$) and also MSFT may deserve its run up after years of oscillating .... will we see msft get to 45 this time around? The chart is telling me that it is due to step up!!! so I am betting on a new trading range between 35 to 50 in the next 12 months. I think there are just too much money being printed out there and some of them will have to find home in msft. Unless we see Windows 8 starts to aggressively eating away the market share in tablets, phones and PCs.... we won't see the 60s. However, I won't rule that out. Since I believe that with Windows 8, MSFT has the opportunity to be the Oracle for the personal computing space for all businesses.</Msg><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1360656199219</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 03:03:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360662445075-8</Id><Topic><Title>love and hate</Title><Username>fpl1971</Username><Timestamp>1360656199219</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 03:03:19 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Windows 8 blows. 25 in 6 months.</Msg><Username>hahahacreek</Username><Timestamp>1360662445075</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 04:47:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360662976077-9</Id><Title>The Impact of Microsoft Office for Ubuntu</Title><Msg>Google it. Quoting: "If the rumors are true and Microsoft releases a version of Office for Ubuntu, what will that mean for enterprises, for Ubuntu and for competing products like LibreOffice and Google Docs? February 11, 2013 By Matt Hartley "Over the past couple of weeks, the Linux news headlines have been dominated with the unconfirmed possibility that Microsoft could be releasing its Office suite for Ubuntu users in 2014. Not too many years ago, the idea of Microsoft having anything to do with Linux would have been laughable. Yet thanks to Ubuntu's burgeoning popularity and its recent efforts in the mobile space, Ubuntu has fast become something of a media darling. Could this be a big enough splash that Microsoft has finally taken notice? "Speaking for myself, I believe it's a serious possibility. "Rationale for Ubuntu Support "In a few short years, Microsoft has gone from bashing Linux to embracing many aspects of it. These days, Microsoft is a top contributor to the Linux kernel and also offers Ubuntu fans Skype for Linux. Despite continuing to push the idea that Microsoft products are better than open source alternatives, I think the company is beginning to accept the reality that Linux (Ubuntu specifically) is a force to be reckoned with." __________________________________________________ Personally, I'll believe it when I see it. But I would never dream of using it.</Msg><Username>wottowwottow</Username><Timestamp>1360662976077</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 04:56:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360669738018-10</Id><Topic><Title>UAW member got an average reported bonus of $5,000, think about that for a minute</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1360631647830</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-02-11 20:14:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"December 12, 2008: General Motors stated that it was nearly out of cash, and may not survive past 2009.

"Betrayed is a good word," former Sgt. Munley told ABC News in a tearful interview to be broadcast tonight on "World News with Diane Sawyer" and "Nightline." "Not to the least little bit have the victims been taken care of," she said. "In fact they've been neglected." There was no immediate comment from the White House about Munley's allegations. Thirteen people were killed, including a pregnant soldier, and 32 others shot in the November 2009 rampage by the accused shooter, Major Nidal Hasan, who now awaits a military trial on charges of premeditated murder and attempted murder. Tonight's broadcast report also includes dramatic new video, obtained by ABC News, taken in the immediate aftermath of the shooting, capturing the chaos and terror of the day.</Msg><Username>hikemanymiles</Username><Timestamp>1360702139310</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 15:48:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360702487187-75</Id><Topic><Title>New Blurtstacks App optimized for Surface Pro to run 750,000 Andriod Apps to Win 8</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1360698564658</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:49:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Android ruined my Lumia! 8^D</Msg><Username>fan_tazer</Username><Timestamp>1360702487187</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 15:54:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360702624685-76</Id><Topic><Title>Surface is good for work and fun</Title><Username>bwu106</Username><Timestamp>1360698117513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:41:57 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you right, partly. don't buy now! chip after haswell even better, so don't buy that either! :-)</Msg><Username>corneliusflake</Username><Timestamp>1360702624685</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 15:57:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360705480675-77</Id><Topic><Title>Colmes corrected O'Reilly's false claim that Bush didn't say "mission accomplished":</Title><Username>jebus_watches_foxnews</Username><Timestamp>1360690203305</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 12:30:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"You cannot correct what is true" Your comment does not change it from a lie.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1360705480675</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:44:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360705562910-78</Id><Topic><Title>We Broke Thru 14000 - THANKS OBAMA FOR YOUR STEWARDSHIP!</Title><Username>jebus_watches_foxnews</Username><Timestamp>1360700430148</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 15:20:30 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I say he didn't</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1360705562910</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 16:46:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360706095322-79</Id><Topic><Title>It's true, toxic mortgages masqueraded as AAA</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1360696022511</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-12 14:07:02 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I thought you and your kind didn't like govement overseeing anything, private sector handles it better.

The speech had been send to me in Iraq to edit. I made some critically important edits. The draft said, in effect, that "the war is over." I changed it to read something like, "Major combat operations are over." I felt the war wasn't over and that the White House was rushing it. They put in my changes. That saved the President a lot of grief, even though we still have problems because of the sign, "Mission Accomplished" It is an example of the importance of the White House giving DoD an opportunity to look at drafts before they go final.
