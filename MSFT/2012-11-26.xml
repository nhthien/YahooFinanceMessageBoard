A lot of these people did grow up in segregation, it isn't all that long ago. Interracial marriage was lillegal in some places until not so long ago. It probably still is somewhere. It's in them. They cn't stand Obama for who he his. Instead of really understanding the Bible, and believing we are all from one source, and seeing every person as a brother or sister, they persist in the old notions that were ignorant.</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1353945845774</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:04:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353945889628-35</Id><Title>Here's what Warren Buffett says about taxes</Title><Msg>Buffett says, as he has before, that modestly higher taxes would not cause him to work any less hard. He points out that, even in the 1960s and 1970s, eras with truly high taxes, these taxes did not stop him and his clients from pursuing investment opportunities. Lastly, he notes that, given the vast sums of money that the richest Americans have banked in the past decade, they will have plenty of money to invest even if taxes rise modestly.</Msg><Username>lugibrious</Username><Timestamp>1353945889628</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:04:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353945982938-36</Id><Title>HFT just took the market down</Title><Msg>Super computers just keep taking stops out to drag the market lower Forcing the selloff again and again</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1353945982938</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:06:22 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353946092950-37</Id><Title>Didn't Bill Gates</Title><Msg>give a "thumbs up" to the INTC-based Surface tablet?</Msg><Username>twitbum</Username><Timestamp>1353946092950</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:08:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353946328297-38</Id><Topic><Title>SURFACE A FLOP, NEXT HP SLATE, NOBODY WANTED ONE NICE TRY ZUNESOFT</Title><Username>stockstar17</Username><Timestamp>1353930918725</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 06:55:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Microsoft crooks can not trap consumers anymore with their garbage ANDROID RULES</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353946328297</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 11:12:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353946616092-39</Id><Topic><Title>SURFACE A FLOP, NEXT HP SLATE, NOBODY WANTED ONE NICE TRY ZUNESOFT</Title><Username>stockstar17</Username><Timestamp>1353930918725</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 06:55:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Just saw that report on CNBC by Gene Munster at Piper Jaffary.

You can see it in Bainer also, and other congressman, they have deep seated racial feelings that the little comments and attitudes expose. On the surface it is all hidden.

Ballmer told app developers at Build 2012 this week, "the level of enthusiasm we've seen is exciting… I think we are really resonating across the board with the work we are bringing to market," according to a report by All Things D. In the consumer market, Microsoft has sold four million Windows 8 upgrades, Ballmer added.</Msg><Username>mystk7</Username><Timestamp>1353954251300</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 13:24:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1353954256269-71</Id><Title>Surface sales</Title><Msg>The stock is down because the surface tablet sales is relatively slow on Black Friday compared IPad.

Gene Munster and his team at Piper Jaffray conducted 8 hours of observations at Apple retail stores in Minneapolis last Friday, also known as the U.S. retail shopping holiday "Black Friday." They found that traffic was up 31 percent year over year, an improvement likely driven by shoppers wanting an opportunity to see new new iPad mini. Their time spent at the Apple Store found that an average of 17.2 items were purchased per hour. In comparison, two hours spent outside a Microsoft Store found that 3.5 items were purchased per hour — and none of those were of the new Surface tablet. In fact, all but two of the purchases from the Microsoft store were games for its Xbox game console. =============================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1353962606704</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 15:43:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353962779695-129</Id><Topic><Title>For Li-ar hawcraper, a change in alias doesn't change his lying.

By charging more for something it calls a "user client-access license," Microsoft is going to hit businesses where employees use its software on more than one device with a stealth price hike. That's going to be painful for a lot of companies, thanks to the bring-your-own-device trend, where employees use their own tablets, laptops, or smartphones for work. Here's how it works: Whenever a business buys Microsoft software, such as SharePoint, it pays for two pieces. It pays for the software that runs on a computer server, and then it pays a fee for the number of "clients" that use that software. In this way, a company with 10,000 employees pays more for Microsoft software than a company with a 1,000 employees. Microsoft has two kinds of client access licenses, or CALs. One is a "device CAL" and it covers each device, no matter how many employees use that device. This is good for companies where one PC is shared by many employees, such as a PC in a nurse's station or a warehouse. The other is a "user CAL" and it covers each employee, no matter how many devices that employee uses. This is good for companies who want to let their employees access work files and emails from home computers, tablets, and smartphones. It used to be that device CALs and user CALs cost the same—making the user CAL a much smarter bet for bring-your-own-device workplaces. But on December 1, Microsoft will be increasing the prices for the user CAL by 15 percent, reports ZDNet's Mary Jo Foley. An enterprise that has a multiyear agreement with Microsoft won't be faced with a price increase until that agreement expires. Enterprise CIOs will not be happy. But they don't have a lot of choice, because they need Windows to run most of their enterprise software, even as employees bring iPhones, iPads, and Android devices to work. (The higher price affects Windows phones and Surface tablets, too, of course—though companies can probably score a better deal from Microsoft for an all-Windows workplace.) Here's a list of the software that will cost more, courtesy of Microsoft reseller SHI.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1353969066112</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 17:31:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353970326747-138</Id><Topic><Title>Why do we still have the 1990's Ballmer guy.

Ambassador Susan Rice as the next secretary of state began to crack Sunday as Sen. John McCain said she was "not the problem" in the White House's handling of the Sept. 11 attack in Libya and suggested he could be persuaded to swing behind her possible nomination. Unclassified talking points provided to Rice and other administration officials in the days following the attack omitted references to terrorists and al-Qaida because intelligence officials said the information was tenuous and could tip their hand in the investigation. The administration also didn't want to prejudice a criminal investigation. Rice said she used those talking points in Sept. 16 interviews in defending the administration's protection of overseas diplomats, saying "clusters of extremists" had "hijacked" film protests. Officials say it wasn't until after Rice spoke that intelligence agencies adjusted the assessment to clarify that the attack was not spontaneous or related to a protest.</Msg><Username>lordbalzy_the_holy</Username><Timestamp>1353976638765</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 19:37:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1353976689917-146</Id><Topic><Title>Ambassador Rice told a story that was known to be false at least 4 days before she told it</Title><Username>hawcreek12</Username><Timestamp>1353975720868</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-26 19:22:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>When you are immersed in Hawcreek Hell, there is never an end to his stories.
