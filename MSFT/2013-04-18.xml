Again he lies. A six-term veteran, Baucus expects a tough re-election in 2014. He's still trying to recover from approval ratings that nosedived amid displeasure with the health care law in his home state. Normally low-key and supportive, Baucus challenged Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius at Wednesday's hearing. He said he's "very concerned" that new health insurance marketplaces for consumers and small businesses will not open on time in every state, and that if they do, they might just flop because residents don't have the information they need to make choices. "The administration's public information campaign on the benefits of the Affordable Care Act deserves a failing grade," he told Sebelius. "You need to fix this." Responding to Baucus, Sebelius pointedly noted that Republicans in Congress last year blocked funding for carrying out the health care law, and she had to resort to raiding other legally available departmental funds. The administration is asking for $1.5 billion in next year's budget, and Republicans don't seem willing to grant that, either. At one point, as Sebelius tried to answer Baucus' demand for facts and figures, the senator admonished: "You haven't given me any data; you just give me concepts, frankly." "I don't know what he's looking at," Sebelius told reporters following her out of the room after Baucus adjourned the hearing. "But we are on track to fully implement marketplaces in Jan. 2014, and to be open for open enrollment." That open-enrollment launch is only months away, Oct. 1. It's when millions of middle-class consumers who don't get coverage through their jobs can start shopping for a private plan in the new marketplaces. They'll also be able to find out if they qualify for tax credits that will lower their premiums. At the same time, low-income people will be steered to government programs, mainly an expanded version of Mf</Msg><Username>peppeek</Username><Timestamp>1366293620434</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:00:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366294030103-30</Id><Topic><Title>Boston Bomber is Saudi National</Title><Username>plmartin2012</Username><Timestamp>1366292264766</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:37:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hawfaeces12, your party of two idiot aliases are out on their own today.

But this is stock market rigging at its finest.</Msg><Username>gregthurell</Username><Timestamp>1366311436064</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:57:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366311494539-73</Id><Topic><Title>Obama set off the texas blasts</Title><Username>kinderyimmy9</Username><Timestamp>1366298369443</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 11:19:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you rape children, stay tuned for my affadavits proving it...</Msg><Username>gregthurell</Username><Timestamp>1366311494539</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:58:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366311661900-74</Id><Topic><Title>Win XP is outdated and all the IT industry has to upgrade to either Win7 or Win8.

The integrated products are intended to help enable simplified deployment and operations of data centers utilizing products adherent to Cisco's Unified Data Center and Microsoft's Fast Track 3.0 architectures. By giving Microsoft customers programmatic access to the Cisco Unified Computing System, Cisco is looking to give customers more insight and control over how Cisco Unified Data Center elements work with Windows Server and application software. [ GETTING CLOSER: Windows Server 2012 embraces the data center ] Cisco is now supporting Microsoft's Windows Server 2012 Hyper-V Extensible Switch and System Center Virtual Machine Manager 2012 SP1 in its Nexus 1000V virtual switch. This is intended to allow customers to virtualize certain aspects of their data center networks alongside physical networking and cloud computing infrastructure, Cisco says. It also brings VM awareness to the physical network through integration with the Cisco UCS VM-FEX capability on its virtual interface card. With UCS VM-FEX administrators can treat the physical and virtual elements of their networks as a single infrastructure for provisioning, configuration, management, monitoring and troubleshooting. Through the UCS Manager's XML-based Open API, users of Microsoft's Systems center 2012 SP1 application can access Cisco's PowerTool of Microsoft's PowerShell utility to provision, configure, orchestrate and monitor physical and virtual infrastructures, and Windows Server and application software running on UCS servers. The Cisco UCS Management Pack for System Center 2012 SP1 Operations Manager allows customers to monitor and manage their Cisco Unified Data Center with a single interface, Cisco says.

It also built its first data center. By today’s standards it was a modest operation: a 89,000-square-foot facility in Building 11 of its Redmond, Washington, campus. Since then the company has spent more than $15 billion, building out much more massive facilities that power its internet-based products such as Bing, Skype and Windows Azure. Microsoft is one of a handful of internet giants that are reinventing the way data centers work. Along with Google, Amazon, Facebook and a few others, they’re building massive, highly reliable data centers that do the back-end computing for billions of PCs and mobile devices. They design their own computers, hack out their own networking protocols and even switches. They experiment with state-of-the art cooling and power generation systems. Much of this work is a collection of jealously guarded trade secrets. But every now and then these companies give us a peek behind the curtain. At Microsoft, the large-scale build-outs really started in 2006, when the software company began work on a 500,000-square-foot data center in Quincy, Washington. Up until that time, Building 11 aside, Microsoft had mostly rented space in large data-center co-location facilities. With Quincy, though, it designed everything from the ground up. “Our footprint was growing significantly and we were in the height of the online services and web services shift,” says David Gauthier, Microsoft’s director of datacenter architecture &amp; design management. “We realized, man we’re going to have to figure out how to build and design our own data centers.”</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366327483520</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:24:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366327582915-221</Id><Topic><Title>Microsoft’s Data-Center Tab Tops $15 Billion</Title><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366327483520</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:24:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>M$ copying Google again.

Klein steps down, Ballmer's future looking uncertain.</Title><Msg>No one is fooled by the lies... ------------------------------ Microsoft has released its financial results for the third financial quarter of 2013 and the results make uncertain reading for CEO Steve Ballmer, who is also about to lose his chief financial officer Peter Klein. Microsoft's fundamental problem is that its core PC market is shrinking faster than expected and the company shows no signs of making up the customer shortfall in tablets and smartphones. Sales of Microsoft's Surface RT and Pro tablets have been lackluster, while Windows 8 has few adherents and faces a resurgent BlackBerry in competition for third place in the smartphone sector. Windows 8 isn't as unpopular as Vista but it certainly doesn't have customers flocking to buy it either, or the touchscreen hardware it runs best on. Intel promised earlier this week that the price of base-spec laptops with touch could fall as low as $200, but then again Chipzilla forecast $699 Ultrabooks by now and we're still waiting. Steve Ballmer is running out of time on this, and he knows it. His tenure as CEO has not been a happy one and with no sign of the rot stopping questions are increasingly being asked about finding a successor for its employee of over 33 years. --------------------------------</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366327752320</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:29:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366327986025-223</Id><Topic><Title>the new and the old</Title><Username>x2073</Username><Timestamp>1366326520744</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:08:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Some 'smart' people must have shorted this and went long Ibm and goog.</Msg><Username>x2073</Username><Timestamp>1366327986025</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:33:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366328070761-224</Id><Title>huge miss estimeates were 77 cents cut just days ago</Title><Msg>WHat a scam saying they beat!!!!!!</Msg><Username>seapilot28</Username><Timestamp>1366328070761</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 19:34:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366328183324-225</Id><Title>Bulging with employees &amp; employee expense!</Title><Msg>This company is overflowing with excess employees and has been for a very long time.

Ponder on this figure: in total WP7 and WP8 combined, Nokia only sold 19.9 million Lumia phones. That's it. To put this into perspective: in the first quarter Nokia sold Lumia devices (Q3 2011), Nokia still sold close to 20 million Symbian devices. In other words, Nokia was pumping out more Symbian phones per quarter in 2011 than it has sold Lumia phones in total to date. There is simply no way to spin this. This is also terrible news for Microsoft. If Nokia only sold 19.9 million WP7/8 devices in total, that means the total sales for Windows Phone will be round and about 25 million tops, and even in the last quarter, 1/3 of WP sales were old, outdated and non-upgradeable Windows Phone 7 devices. As much as I like Windows Phone, we simply have to face the music, be honest, and just come out and say it: Windows Phone is a dud ==============================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1366334198327</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:16:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>10</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366334495663-243</Id><Topic><Title>Buying MSFT now is like buying AAPL 10 years back.</Title><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1366321088099</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:38:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There are far more options to Skype than Google's.
