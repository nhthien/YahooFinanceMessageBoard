It is not available to Windows Phone and Microsoft and Nokia have been desperately trying to allow it's users the opportunity to use the service. Microsoft has even written the code in their programming language since the Instagram has been saying "we our working on a Windows Phone version" forever. So as a Facebook shareholder I and perhaps you may be saying what is going on that would give Instagram Billions of more users to sell advertising to. Yes everyone is thinking the same and it get's worse they are also doing it to blackberry users. So Mark Zuckerberg is acting like a college kid in the dorm in some on some type of garden roots hippie trip. What is it going to take to get the guy to start doing things to make shareholders money. Here are Billions &amp; Billions of users on the Windows and Blackberry phones to serve ad to and he is playing college kid with an attitude. It is starting to be clear to me that the only way this thing get's over 38 is if he is not the ceo but maybe a programmer. Than he can do the hippie college kid in the dorm trip and let someone else run the business. Give him an office and he can put posters on the walls get a black light and sit back there and smoke pot all day why someone else runs the business. What if someone else creates a competing Instagram app and announces they will never sell user photos. That has already happened. What is up with Zuck?</Msg><Username>ineedastock</Username><Timestamp>1363870332342</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 08:52:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363871067630-6</Id><Topic><Title>Challenge For Hawcreek ....</Title><Username>cyber_critiquer</Username><Timestamp>1363834828979</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 23:00:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Wrong, bonehead, again and still.

The sequester cuts back on training. Harry Reid made no such silly connection to say cutting back on training caused the training accident. In fact it makes zero sense, doesn't it, Mr. Feeces? If the Marines hadn't been training, all would be alive. Time to air out your room again. And: UPDATE 9:46 p.m.: A Marine spokesman said comments by unidentified Marines critical of Reid’s remarks that appeared in other press accounts did not reflect the Marine Corps’ position. In a statement Col. Chris Hughes, deputy director of U.S. Marine Corps Public Affairs, said, “The comments are unsubstantiated and certainly do not reflect the Marine Corps’ position on this matter.” An earlier version of this story incorrectly characterized Hughes’ statement as being a response to Sen. Reid’s comments. Bozo brains on the right just can't stop it.

Sens. Susan Collins (R-Maine) and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) both offered amendments to move the president and vice president into the healthcare law's exchanges. After the Affordable Care Act passed, the White House said Obama would enroll in an exchange once the time came in 2014. Collins and Ayotte's amendments would require the president, the vice president and the Cabinet to put their premiums where their politics are. . Lawmakers and most of their staff members already have to purchase coverage through an exchange, thanks to a provision Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) added to the healthcare law. But the White House and its staff aren't covered by that provision. Some congressional leadership staffers also aren't affected, and can remain in the healthcare exchange for federal employees. All of the budget amendments are messaging documents — as is the budget itself. And there are a slew of proposals to repeal all or part of the Affordable Care Act.

The news means Ubuntu-stewards Canonical will work with China's National University of Defense Technology, and The China Software and Integrated Chip Promotions Center, to develop a Chinese-flavored version of the popular Linux distribution. This software will help China provide "a flexible, open, widely-used and standardized operating system," Canonical said on Thursday. "This collaboration will bring local investment and participation to ensure that the platform is relevant for the Chinese market, and close coordination with the global Ubuntu project ensures that it is familiar to software and hardware vendors, and useful for export products made by Chinese companies as well," Canonical chief executive Jane Silber said in a statement. A "CCN Open Source Innovation Joint Lab" has been create in Beijing where where engineers from all three organizations will code "an enhanced version of the Ubuntu desktop with features specific to the Chinese market". The first distribution made under this scheme will come out in April 2013 and will be named Ubuntu Kylin. Chinese specific features in the 13.04 release include Chinese input methods and Chinese calendars, along with weather indicators and integration of various Chinese sites into the Dash. ================</Msg><Username>phands.theheretic5</Username><Timestamp>1363916486756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-03-21 21:41:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message></Date>
