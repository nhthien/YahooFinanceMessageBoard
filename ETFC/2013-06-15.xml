True story. We currently live in an area that used to be all white, probably because all da houses are $500K and uppity. Fannie &amp; Freddie changed all that, now about 12% of this neighborhood is black. Strangely, 80% of those homes go into foreclosure or short sell. I wonder why? At this rate, da neighborhood will be all white again, except for a few exceptions. One of our neighbors happens to be a member of da city council. She's a BOD and a consultant to the State, making about $390K. Problem is, she can't read past da 3rd grade level. Oh, she's about 1st grade on math stuff-great for me because she comes to me to do her taxes. She is unmarried right now, but, has 6 daughters. Her 5 oldest daughters will not talk to any white person over 18. Da youngest one, about 11 does talk, and you should listen to what she says about what her mommie thinks about white people-it ain't good. It's interesting that despite the racist attitude of her mommie, she still thinks everybody should get along and goes out of her way to make friends with white SOBs, her mommie hates. I guess there's hope for da future, but, I wonder if she will fell this way when she's 18? Bottom line, I guess we're all racists, admit it or not, but, da mostest invidious attitudes are not necessarily da white Pilgrims. C Yaz - Da Bear Cares [CGDGE] ( Lessons on life from Da Bear.

Not even close. Instead of just copying a brief definition from Wiki, study the Gestapo. These sicko's were true believers. Most people that the Gestapo picked up never returned home. The IRS sends people forms. If an American citizen disagrees with an IRS decision or Audit, he/she can argue their case in Tax Court. A judge will determine the merits of that person's case based on law. A person may do jail time if he/she loses in court, but you get a fair trial first. The Gestapo were excellent record keepers of the people the tortured, executed or sent to the "camps". But not so big on send out forms. The Gestapo was responsible to Hitler. Hitler let them do pretty much anything they wanted to maintain fear and order. ALL of the agencies you listed are responsible to some form of oversight by all three branches of our Government. As we saw with the recent IRS scandal. If, the IRS were the Gestapo, none of the Tea Party applications would have been allowed to contest anything. Congress would not have been allowed to hold hearings.</Msg><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1371314225140</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 12:37:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371316369014-7</Id><Topic><Title>Our IRS and the Gestapo</Title><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1371314225140</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 12:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, taxes should be voluntary!.

Senate Dem’s Plan: Spend Border Security Funds On Immigrant Healthcare Sen. Barbara Boxer is planning an amendment to the Senate's immigration bill which would redirect funds committed to border security to reimburse state and local governments providing health care to newly legalized immigrants. Boxer plans to take $250 million, and likely much more, out of border security and use it to underwrite uninsured immigrants health care costs. Supporters of the Senate bill have stressed repeatedly that newly legalized immigrants wouldn't be eligible for federal welfare benefits. In almost half the states, however, they would be eligible for state and local government assistance. The legalization in the Senate bill would put a strain on already stretched government budgets.</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1371318827749</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 13:53:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371318841875-10</Id><Topic><Title>Our IRS and the Gestapo</Title><Username>rampant_rose</Username><Timestamp>1371314225140</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 12:37:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>octopus, Will you kindly rephrase your post - so that even I may understand what you're trying to convey to this board and me.</Msg><Username>dems_win</Username><Timestamp>1371318841875</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 13:54:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371321092528-11</Id><Topic><Title>Bush did 6 years of warrantless wiretapping ..... fox and friends toe tapped through all of that, that was all good</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1371302206639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 09:16:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>whatever bush could do BO can do better.....</Msg><Username>investorelvis</Username><Timestamp>1371321092528</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:31:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371322024231-12</Id><Topic><Title>Bush did 6 years of warrantless wiretapping ..... fox and friends toe tapped through all of that, that was all good</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1371302206639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 09:16:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>From 2001 to 2007, it's still Obama's fault.</Msg><Username>anotherwingnutloser</Username><Timestamp>1371322024231</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:47:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371322302314-13</Id><Topic><Title>Bush did 6 years of warrantless wiretapping ..... fox and friends toe tapped through all of that, that was all good</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1371302206639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 09:16:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and he did, Bush only listened in on conversations occurring that either originated or started outside the United States, what the Obama administration has done goes far far beyond that. Think of them as having their own private version of Google that can look up just about anything, browse ALL sections of your Facebook pages, Google search history, AND your telephone records from within the United States, all sitting there waiting for whatever agency wants it. So, the IRS merges the list of people who's search histories indicate that they're Republican's who've been looking up how to avoid taxes, and audits all of them. Or say a Right Wing Christian later gets into office and decides Homosexuality is a Plague That Must Be Eradicated, so he uses private eMail and Facebook pages, etc, to catch and quarantine as many as he can . . . Starting to see the difference between a list of paired phone numbers and the information that provides as compares to a TOTAL information awareness of all non-personal communication except transfer by private courier? With that kind of data I could RULE the markets. TIA has been a dream of intelligence agencies for years, and I have no problem with that, as long as they DON'T map the citizens of the Untied States and then using it without them being notified of the warrant authorizing law enforcement to access the association map the software creates. The NSA Spectrum line of intelligence gathering has a great deal of elements, but the VAST expansion over the last 5 years as the Obama administration has turned to fighting the war mainly through black ops and drone assassinations has been both INCREDIBLY useful, and in many ways represents a great danger if in the wrong hands. The idea is now that the public knows about the program and knows who's hands its in (someone who doesn't use government agencies against his POLITICAL enemies) and they create some method of notification, we can monitor the program for abuses.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371322302314</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 14:51:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371322908731-14</Id><Topic><Title>time to heed Ike's warning of the military industrial complex?

It was sensible and understandable tool. Sometimes it was without warrant only because at the time calls were made it was too late to obtain the warrant. Problem is, Obama didn't like it. He didn't trust Bush intercepting calls from maybe few hundreds suspects. So now we have to trust Obama collecting data from tens of millions of US citizens.

Muhammad Atta was a GREAT operational planner, and one of Al Queda's BIGGEST mistakes was actually letting him participate in the mission as well as organize it. I've gone over everything they did and didn't do, and given unfamiliarity with a foreign country and the lean pickings he had to work with as operators, his execution was excellent. Remember, at the time only paranoid folks like me thought of airliners as both transportation and poorly guarded oversized potential cruise missiles, no one else really considered the potential energy of a fully fueled transcontinental airliner smacking into a city. Hence my suggestions in the late 1990's that such a system SHOULD be installed in New York, Washington, and a few other strategically critical targets were considered "unnecessary and potentially dangerous to civil aviation". Yah, a 30mm gatling gun is a kind of extreme way to protect your building, but when the building's worth billions is politically sensitive and someone's already tried to blow it up once, spending 6 figures on a CWIS system just seems like prudence, not paranoia.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1371327052533</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 16:10:52 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371327250330-20</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Ousts Ahmadinejad !</Title><Username>anotherwingnutloser</Username><Timestamp>1371324299715</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 15:24:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Er, you do know Ahmadinejad ran into term limits right? e.g. he wasn't allowed to run this time.

"Snowden told the Guardian he enlisted in the U.S. Army in 2003 in an effort to become an Army Green Beret – dropping out when he broke both legs in a training accident. In an online post later apparently penned by Snowden, he talks about breaking both his legs during AIT, or Advanced Infantry Training, but does not say how it happened. Army officials at the Pentagon said Snowden actually didn't enlist until May 7, 2004 and reported for duty at Fort Benning, Georgia, a month later for a special program to train enlistees for a career in Special Forces. Snowden was assigned to the 198th Infantry Brigade for his training. The Army said Snowden was "administratively discharged" as a private first class, but cited the federal Privacy Act in declining to say more. ....................... David Charney, a psychiatrist who works regularly with CIA agents and who has personally evaluated some of the nation's most notorious spies, said in an interview that Snowden appears to fit a familiar archetype – that of a man who is perpetually trying to prove that he is smarter than his resume may indicate. "He comes across to me as being fiercely bright and articulate, there's a mismatch between how his life went before and what he is actually," Charney said. "And that discrepancy is the thing that makes some people say, 'I'm going to prove to the world, I'm going to show everybody that I'm smarter than they think I am.'"</Msg><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1371330140084</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 17:02:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371330772824-24</Id><Topic><Title>Sean Hannity’s Breathtaking Hypocrisy on NSA Surveillance ( same as with many on this board)</Title><Username>luckyskywaltzer</Username><Timestamp>1371214070962</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-06-14 08:47:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>yeah, mr Boehner is such a dimwit that along with most ALL pubs in the congress they are defending the NSA even though the evil one has been running it in secret according to you.

AND it was publicly disclosed thanks to criticism on Democrat side including Senator Obama. Today we learn about new Patriot Act from some high school drop out. It upsets way too many on all sides of political spectrum. But you are trying to make it look partisan. It isn't. Support for such broad NSA surveillance is very far from universal on either side of the isle. Your ALL is completely false.</Msg><Username>pacifican54</Username><Timestamp>1371354390165</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 23:46:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1371354642298-30</Id><Topic><Title>Dems CRUSH Republicans 22 to ZIP !</Title><Username>anotherwingnutloser</Username><Timestamp>1371335632618</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 18:33:52 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Heh !

We live in different times and the Fuehrer does not fit into the equation. I don't think the Fuehrer had to be content with homegrown or foreign terrorists, but since Afghanistan and Iraq this country does. I gladly give up some of my liberties in order to have our government keep me, my family, and our country safe. Again, I believe the testimony of General Alexander before congress, and I don't see why an honerable General would lie. bidder, Rasmussen is very partisan and usuall wrong with its polls.</Msg><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1371354815551</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-06-15 23:53:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message></Date>
