Caligula was awarded to me as a callsign (all good ones are given then made yours not created by yourself) after I did something particularly spectacular, a winning move, yet bereft of any ethical considerations at all. I suppose someone else decided to call you "luckyskywaltzer" and it just stuck? I've published gaming titles with my callsign in my name, so I've made it mine, but you, your profile isn't even filled out.

Short term gains. I can only take so much in short term gains in a year without invoking the tax man so I really don't care to do it that often. I suppose I could have just held them but though they were undervalued the recent climb pushed them from my buy range to my "take the money and run" range. So for long range now I have mostly the late bloomers left, true, but bloom they will oh yes, for I made sure to buy companies whose value is NOT currently reflected in their stock price. You may have to wait alittle while, but I prefer long term gains, I can take about 200k in long term gains a year without tax consequences, ten times what I can harvest in short term gains. In fact I'm going to have to be sort of careful about that starting about July or so if this keeps up. In fact I had been trading in and out on the swings, but the math showed I may overrun my allowable gains for the year, so I moved normally short term assets I margined to LEAPS just so maybe I could move into a semi-stable position I can afford to ignore for a month during November of this year, maybe take a month off with only an occasional glance at the markets, depending on if I get my country house built in time and when deer season is. As for my European gains (an experiment) it appears I have to file to get the taxes withheld on my dividends back. Weird tax rules those Europeans have. I think they have like 16£ or so total, but last was just my first half year investing there, so I should try to get it back as practice if nothing else.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368599343233</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 02:29:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368600115183-5</Id><Topic><Title>The days are looking up</Title><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1368571313689</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 18:41:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You don't get it. I doubt this was more than just Liberal Logic as applied to the individual. These people have been SO indoctrinated to think that conservatives MUST be cheating (because among the "actually working" class conservatives are a fair majority) to have gotten so nice a house and car and . . . so since THEY would cheat in this situation, it was ok for the Self Appointed Voice of Justice liberal civil servant to use to power to root out evil. And the funny part is that is probably PRECISELY how they saw it going in. Of course higher management MAY have known about it before the election, but they too meant well. How would it look for President Obama's tax collection bureau to be seen as taking on "petty quarrels" (Never mind that the intent in my cases was to ruin people or organizations based on political philosophy) during an election, surly this is something that could wait? Then as they waited they realized their stonewalling has turned into a conspiracy of silence, so instead of coming forward they decide to bury it . . . Until someone inconveniently dug up the body. So, give this "right thinking Liberal crusaders" a hand from their side, they "took one for the team", and, well, if you believe in liberty, you believe that they shouldn't see anything but steel bars for the rest of their lives. Abuse of personal information and use of agency resources by the IRS, the one agency we exempt from most privacy laws, in unacceptable. Employees who engage in such activity should have the inverse of the law that protects federal law enforcements killed in the line of duty and if ANY deaths be caused therein or be found to be aggravated by those IRS activities, they should suffer the same penalty. The days that IRS could hound people to death were supposed to be over, the days where they could hound them to death to advance a political agenda were thought to have ended with the Red Scare.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368600115183</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 02:41:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368622096977-6</Id><Title>I wrote Boehner and Issa to join me in a national poop sling</Title><Msg>bring your rear ends and your gerbils too!

Among the ministries targeted are the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, Samaritan’s Purse and the Biblical Recorder – the newspaper of the North Carolina Baptist State Convention. The revelations seem to indicate the IRS was targeting more than just Tea Party groups and conservative political organizations. “I am bringing this to your attention because I believe that someone in the Administration was targeting and attempting to intimidate us,” wrote Franklin Graham in a letter Tuesday to President Obama. “This is morally wrong and unethical – indeed some would call it ‘un-American.’”</Msg><Username>biddermon_ca</Username><Timestamp>1368642893672</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 14:34:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368643092217-51</Id><Title>Fake New Revelations (Hillary-Benghazi)</Title><Msg>Nice try..Gerbil Stuffers!!

But it has to have a set trigger in the style of the late 18th Century. My father build me a full stock .36 caliber boys rifle when I was a kid and showed interest in shooting blackpowder, but now it doesn't fit right even in my skinny shoulder. There's a pin in the action that needs replaced, but its hard to find near 200 year old hand forged pins of a certain size, and both actions and barrels of both his and my rifle and the pistol he build are originals, frankly I'm thinking of just replacing it with a modern drift pin and be done with it. I may eventually inherit the big .45 he uses for primitive weapons season, but not until he's dead and well cooled off, he's rather found of it, and I already have two of the three. And we don't shoot pyrodex, though I may try it, we use blackpowder and target shoot with patch and ball and hunt with miniballs just because they assure a cleaner kill if you hit a larger deer. I suppose the .50's and worse the .66's don't need it, but though my dad got a deer using a ball alone I lack the ability to track wounded game as easily, and so largely rely on shot that result in clean kills or total misses. No Flintlocks either, no way, I got enough to worry about without adding a weird lock mechanism with yet another grade of powder that you do NOT want to mix up with main charge powder.</Msg><Username>clgl_fubar</Username><Timestamp>1368650748881</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:45:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368651290916-68</Id><Topic><Title>New revelations - Benghazi</Title><Username>liberal_hollywood</Username><Timestamp>1368641336375</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 14:08:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>“The embassy was told through back channels to not make direct requests for security,” an official familiar with the case, who agreed to discuss the case only anonymously because of the sensitivity of the subject, told McClatchy.
