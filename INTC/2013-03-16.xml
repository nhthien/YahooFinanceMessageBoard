I found the following interesting bit: "On 22 January 2013, the Competition Commission of India (CCI) approved the proposed acquisition by Intel Corporation (Intel) of certain assets of Motorola Mobility LLC (MM LLC), including non-Indian intellectual property rights-patents and patent applications; tangible assets of MM LLC located in the US; and rights to hire some US employees of MM LLC, relating to the development of technologies used in the components of wireless handheld devices known as cellular baseband processors." I also found the following article which says that Motorola had used their own LTE chipset for the Motorola Droid Bionic (2011) phone: ubergizmoDOTcom/2011/09/motorola-droid-bionic-teardown-reveals-custom-lte-chipset/ Anyways, between Infineon, XMM 7160 and their Motorola Mobility asset acquisition, I would say Intel is building quite a bit of IP for baseband. I would not be surprised to see a phone released this year with Intel inside supporting LTE 4G.</Msg><Username>bacbacker</Username><Timestamp>1363407189799</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 00:13:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363407731820-2</Id><Title>Covello - the chip equipment "analyst"</Title><Msg>9 years ago Covello slammed chip equipment stocks - he created a certain perception and it took a long, long time to overcome it. This blurb is almost 9 years old - ....can you see similarities - he's trying to kill Intel foundry business off before it happens, "Regarding Covello: It seems that he is trying to kill off the semi equipment recovery before it has even happened! Covello's new view on the industry is based on how cyclical stocks trade, as compared with cyclical growth stocks, and a calculation that margins on earnings before income taxes, depreciation and amortization are declining over time for the chip-equipment industry. "We not only believe that the semiconductor-equipment industry is a pure cyclical, but we also believe that the stocks are trading as such as the market is beginning to acknowledge these long-term negative secular trends." Based on this, he used normalized levels of cash flow as an indicator for stock peaks. When Applied Materials, the equipment industry's largest player, reports financial results Feb. 18, EBITDA margins should reach a cycle-average of 18 percent, Covello predicted. "When an investor owns a stock, he or she owns the future stream of cash flows that the stock provides. Once an industry moves beyond normalized levels of free cash flow, that stream of cash flows is by definition unsustainable, and no one should own a stream of anything that is unsustainable." He said current cash flows are unsustainable as a downturn is inevitable, and, thus, forward-looking investors are likely to cease driving industry stocks higher at a faster rate than the overall market. "We not only believe that the semiconductor-equipment industry is a pure cyclical, but we also believe that the stocks are trading as such as the market is beginning to acknowledge these long-term negative secular trends."</Msg><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363407731820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 00:22:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363409356608-3</Id><Topic><Title>Covello - the chip equipment "analyst"</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363407731820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 00:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Covello suggests KLA-Tencor and FormFactor Inc.

Intel is intending to demonstrate the advantages of x86 and the limitations of ARM. Specifically that is first to run full Windows 8 plus also be able to run any "nix" variant, desktop or mobile. That multi-OS capability is one of the most compelling advantages Intel has but that advantage begins with Windows and its application ecosystem. That strategy is effective today for Ultrabooks and tablets and will soon be extended to Intel based smartphones. Intel can support Chrome, Ubuntu-Touch, Tizen, Debian, and Red Hat for that matter, but these are all in addition to Windows.</Msg><Username>merlot_1</Username><Timestamp>1363449471100</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 11:57:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363454650188-14</Id><Topic><Title>Covello - the chip equipment "analyst"</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363407731820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 00:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>right on the mark, merlot.

Why Goldman Sachs Just Dropped A Huge SELL Rating On Intel The most dramatic call you'll see today: A big fat SELL rating on Intel from Goldman Sachs. A blue chip firm putting such a negative rating on a blue chip stock that's been doing great always deserves some attention. Here are the key points behind the rating from Goldman's James Covello: The 22% M/M growth in the stock post-earnings is way out of line. Processor shipments are going to slow over the course of the year, in part because processors have been outselling PCS, and thus there's a catch-up effect. Due to average selling price declines and excess capacity, 2012 sales will be flat. Increased competition from ARM-based processors in tablets will also hit the company. In a related note, Goldman also has bearish commentary on the rest of the semiconductor industry: Inventory at all notebook makers are growing. 2010-2012 period is seeing huge capacity increases for the whole industry that will lead to oversupply. During past cycles, equipment orders declined in each of the past two quarters following the cyclical peak. The firm also downgraded KLA to Sell and Applied Materials to Neutral. Intel stock on May 19, 2011 was $23 KLA stock was about $41 And AMAT was about $14. The only one he got it right on was AMAT as the stock went down in the next 12 months. But Intel went to $29 in 12 months which is a 25% rise While KLA went to $46 which is a 12% rise So only 33% correct. You could do better in Vegas going red or black on the roulette wheel. Now he expects Intel to drop to $16, after Intel makes some huge advancements in the cell phone market. What a joke of an ANALyst!</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1363461384830</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 15:16:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363461483757-16</Id><Topic><Title>Covello - the chip equipment "analyst"</Title><Username>semi_equip_junkie</Username><Timestamp>1363407731820</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 00:22:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But he hated KLA at $41 and gave it a sell rating, now he likes it at $52?</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1363461483757</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 15:18:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363464183040-17</Id><Title>Goldman Sachs' record on Intel.</Title><Msg>The last time Goldman had a buy rating on Intel was prior to October of 2008. When the stock was $24 on August of 2008, Goldman Sachs had a buy rating and waited tile it dropped to $16 on October 20, 2008 to drop it to a Neutral. The stock went down for some months but in the end it rose to $20 in less than a year. So they basically allowed the stock to lose about 35% in value before cautioning their investors. On December 13, 2010, they maintain a Neutral rating on Intel while the stock traded at $21.50 a share. So at that point, their downgrade from buy to Neutral cost its investors about a 35% potential gain. That sounds like a strong buy to me. Then on April 20, 2011, they maintain a Neutral on the stock when it was at around $21.50 a share. Right after it rose about $2 because of strong earnings. In lestt than a month, the stock reached almost $24. So they missed their investors another 10% gain in less than a month. Again, that sound like a strong buy to me. Then on May 19, 2011 they slap a big fat Sell rating on the stock while it was around $23.50 a share. Less than 5 months later the stock creeps up to $24 a share when they again maintain a Sell rating and set a $22 target price on October 19, 2011. Less than a month later the stock rises another $1 to $25 when they again maintain a sell rating with the same $22 price target. So in less than one month, investors who listened to this clown Covello missed another 4% pop. Which is at an annual rate of 48%. Less than 6 months later, on May 3, 2012, the stock hit a high of $29.27. So the sell rating cost Goldman clients about anothe 17% rise in less than 6 months. Again, that sounds like a strong buy to me. So after all this, they still maintain a sell rating but have lowered their price target to $16. Given the past record of Goldman Sachs, and more specifically James Covello, on Intel, how can anyone give this clown any credibility? Intel is by far is the best chip company in the world.</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1363464183040</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 16:03:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363464408002-18</Id><Title>The Dividend</Title><Msg>I'm pretty new to Dividends.

(INTC). A company with strong financials, better dividend and a curious and clear divergence between short and long Chartist patterns. We can see INTC in the short time frame as moderate overbought after recent run-up (daily charts). But if you change the photograph to longer time frame graphs (monthly charts) the perspective favors long term investors, ´cause we can see a company forming a nice bullish Inverted Head/shoulders Chartist pattern with a heavy oversold condition watching %Williams oscillator, and with a healthy accumulation on OBV indicator. As a key note to INTC´s near term bullish development, INTC needs to break dynamic resistance (orange line) to confirm second shoulder.

See excerpt below. I agree that this gives Intel a huge competitive advantage. From the opinions of other posters addressing this subject, it appears that there is already some consensus on this...] Can You Say, "True Hybrid"? Intel very recently released a patch for Android 4.2.2 (the latest version) that allows for dual booting of Windows 8 and Android - on the same device! The potential here for a true hybrid - Windows 8 or Android whenever you need one or the other - is actually quite exciting and is a competitive advantage that none of the ARM (ARMH) vendors have. Sure, there is Windows RT (for ARM), but it does not support legacy applications and is therefore unsuitable to take the role of a Windows 8 productivity device. So, imagine this - ASUS, Acer, Lenovo, Samsung, and others can now release tablets based on Intel's upcoming "Bay Trail" (brand new, 4 core, 22nm Atom) silicon that make perfectly good, super thin Android tablets for when the user wants to use it as a tablet, but then when the user wants a full Windows 8 productivity machine, he/she need simply to attach a keyboard (like the ASUS Transformer) and get to using it exactly as a Windows 8 laptop. The value proposition here is absolutely huge, and I hope that the OEMs and ODMs come out with sensible, high quality designs that actually sell. If they can really take advantage of this then Intel and the non-Apple (AAPL) tablet/PC vendors could gain a real upper hand in 2H 2013, when "Bay Trail" and "Haswell" will be readily available in the market. Intel shareholders should be very, very excited.</Msg><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363473717509</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 18:41:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363473920192-35</Id><Topic><Title>Intel/Apple Alternatives and the Intelligence of Mr. Market</Title><Username>wallisweaver</Username><Timestamp>1363466781864</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 16:46:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>New addition to list...
