He is a stubborn analyst that just has an agenda. At the time, Intel was down to $12 and he was trying to push it down further. It obviously did not work too well for him. As for the more current comments he is making about low demand because of hard drive sales, it doesn't make much sense since Intel is keeping its chip prices strong. If demand was weak, Intel would have to drop prices. The latest prossesor price list released just yesterday proves Intel is seeing strong demand for its chips across the board. You would think with some weakness in PC's, Intel would drop at least one of their chip offerrings. But not one! Here's the processor price list for Intel. As anyone can clearly see, Intel has not and is still not dropping any of its chip prices. Strong demand obviously for Intel products. Not so strong for AMD because Intel seems to be the processor of choice. http://files.shareholder.com/downloads/INTC/1676228748x0x586838/93FD9F7A-F52F-4DCC-9498-F9D055E08830/Copy_of_July_29_12_Recommended_Customer_Price_List.pdf</Msg><Username>paul.ottelini</Username><Timestamp>1343806416000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 03:33:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1343821497000-6</Id><Title>ex-date</Title><Msg>Listen, nobody will be selling this premier dividend stock before x-date and Fed announcement which will take to 28 easily.

Intel also remains a laggard in the mobile segment, and although its situation could improve by virtue of its Ultrabook and agreement with Google, Intel has yet to prove itself here. In the meantime, competition from ARM-based devices continues to intensify. Therefore, given the PC market weakness and the fact that mobile devices will continue to eat into its client business, we downgrade Intel shares from Neutral to Underperform.

Expect a strong likelihood that Friday AM, Intel will open trading at $25.80. Just my theory but, it appears that the option market maker has a $26 target in his sites. The last dividend, there was 10mil to 20mil shares arbitraged using several hundred thousand options. Look for strange trading patterns today and tomorrow in a narrow plus/minus dividend range as they settle share purchases. I think that it is entirely possible that the drop from $29 was part of the preparation for tomorrows storm. They will be buying low premium in the money calls today and tomorrow, exercising early and then using long put options to guarantee a disposal price. NOTE: If you wrote covered calls that have a low premium, be prepared for the shares to be called away before the dividend is awarded. Roll the calls out to add premium protection or close them out.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343826068000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 09:01:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343826988000-10</Id><Topic><Title>zack's downgrades intel</Title><Username>swamp_boar</Username><Timestamp>1343825664000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 08:54:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The one that I like is Nomura, Romit Shah.

Speculation is that is will be the iPhone 5. There won't be an iPhone 6 for another year. Does anyone believe that Apple will run for another year with Samsung as the "A" chip supplier? If not, who becomes the new supplier? TSMC:)? Global Foundries? In my mind the Samsung relationship has to be ending and I think it ends completely on Sep 12. Intel and the rumor mill have simply been too quiet for there NOT to be a giant upheaval in the near future. If Apple and Intel aren't kissing and hugging, Intel will soon be making mobile chips for Samsung. I think it will be the Apple design with Arm core(S) to begin with. As time moves on and as Otellini says, Intel designed products will have to become "compelling" enough to be used by Apple.

You never know when a rumor is really a rumor or intentionally planted disinformation. Intel has much IP invested in the x86 and is likely 100% commited to it. Intel has ARM licenses and a number of hetro-CPU patents awarded that enable them to do a number of things. However, I have no idea what the execs at Apple nor Intel really think or are planning outside what is public. My access to Digitimes is through the media. 8-) Inside Apple, there are divisions/groups who are competing with each other. The MAC PC group and the iPad tablet groups are competing with each other for the best product right at the x86/ARM event horizon. The MAC exec is probably proposing lower end MACs that overlap the iPad high end and the reverse. Intel (with products and delivery) must make the MAC group inside Apple more successful than the iPad group. If the MAC group skunkworks iPad86 is better enough than the iPad group offering, then it may persude management to make a shift. It will take a long time, if ever.</Msg><Username>alexander.dumbass</Username><Timestamp>1343841162000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 13:12:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343841228000-24</Id><Topic><Title>Intel to make Apple chips?</Title><Username>semiwiz2002</Username><Timestamp>1343831431000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:30:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>&gt; Mobile phone users have welcomed the iPhone.

But this is about the future. Apple has to evolve its products to maintain its image as a cutting edge company. Customers don't care about 32/28/22/14nm - but they have shown that they love smaller devices that can do more and more. Initial adoption for these smaller geometries (with higher costs) will be by consumers in advanced countries - as volumes increase and costs come down, there will be sufficiently big markets in emerging economies as well. With each smaller process node and increased wafer size, the complexity and capital costs do go up - but cost per unit comes down drastically. Otherwise, no vendor would even have a roadmap to transition to smaller nodes and larger wafer sizes! Intel and the chip industry have a track record in innovating to smaller geometries (and larger wafers). I would give them credit that they know what they are doing.</Msg><Username>ideal_invst</Username><Timestamp>1343841228000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 13:13:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343843852000-25</Id><Topic><Title>Intel to make Apple chips?</Title><Username>semiwiz2002</Username><Timestamp>1343831431000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:30:31 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"The MAC PC group and the iPad tablet groups are competing with each other for the best product right at the x86/ARM event horizon."

In terms of (b), the investment has to be significant. Further, several people from Apple's ARM design team have left over the last year to 18 months. Apple is fully capable of replacing them with new talent. But does it want to continue the race with Intel, especially since Intel is offering custom SoCs based on x86 (and ARM for starters).

The only stock I like better is the "no brainer" investment in SIMG Silicon Image. Silicon Image MHL technology is exploding onto the scene in smartphones, tv, computer monitors. SIMG are the same folks who bring you HDMI High Def Interface and now MHL Mobile High Def Link A micro cap and likely acquired by Intel or Samsung. Their Conf Call transcript and guidance is great but "sandbagged." http://seekingalpha.com/article/767661-silicon-image-s-ceos-discuss-q2-2012-results-earnings-call-transcript?source=yahoo The MHL trend is HUGE in Asia and emerging stateside in Samsung Galaxy S3, HTC, and others. Yes, below is a link to the Galaxy S3 cracked open revealing the SIMG chip: http://www.techrepublic.com/photos/cracking-open-the-samsung-galaxy-s-iii-t-mobile/6370767?seq=58&amp;tag=content;siu-container#photopaging</Msg><Username>midas4longterm</Username><Timestamp>1343850362000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 15:46:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1343851191000-31</Id><Topic><Title>Whats Moving INTC into a Blazing Stock...</Title><Username>schmidtkennith732</Username><Timestamp>1343830814000</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-01 10:20:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope you're right.
