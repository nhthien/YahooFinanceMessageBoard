Michael Dell, Founder, Chairman, and CEO of Dell, Inc. Michael Dell is expected to take majority ownership of the world's third-largest personal computer maker, which currently has a market value of $23 billion, while Silver Lake and Microsoft Corp would become minority investors, a third person familiar with the matter said. The final price the group is expected to pay Dell shareholders could not be immediately learned. The deal would mark the largest leveraged buyout since the global financial crisis. The transaction is set to be finalized over the weekend but the buyout consortium is working on last-minute details and the timetable could still slip, the people cautioned, asking not to be named because the matter is not public. The investment group, which held negotiations with Dell's camp in New York on Thursday, has secured up to $15 billion of debt financing to take Dell private from four investment banks -- Barclays, Bank of America Merrill Lynch, Credit Suisse and RBC Capital, people familiar with the matter said. Barclays is also advising Silver Lake on the transaction, along with Perella Weinberg Partners, said two of the people. JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co is advising Dell. Representatives for Dell, Microsoft and Barclays declined to comment. Silver Lake and Perella Weinberg could not be immediately reached for comment. As part of the transaction, Michael Dell will contribute his existing stake of almost 16 percent in the company toward gaining majority ownership, sources close to the matter have said. Going private would allow Dell, which has been trying to become a one-stop shop for corporate technology needs as the PC market shrinks, to conduct that difficult makeover away from public scrutiny. Dell has formed a special committee of its independent directors and hired Evercore Partners Inc to #$%$ whether the company is getting the best deal for shareholders and not one that is just in the best interest of Michael Dell, several people familiar with the matter have told Reuters previously..</Msg><Username>leogcarrolastopper</Username><Timestamp>1359702476519</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 02:07:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359703194953-3</Id><Title>shareholders wont buy a 2 bit buyout</Title><Msg>no way jaxs</Msg><Username>vomit_breath_taste_good</Username><Timestamp>1359703194953</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 02:19:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359703268361-4</Id><Title>Someone bought 1 million shares @ close</Title><Msg>shorts are bailing out!</Msg><Username>poke_m_in_eyes_dont_look_back</Username><Timestamp>1359703268361</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 02:21:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359704180058-5</Id><Title>Michael Dell once said he would have shut Apple down if he owned it</Title><Msg>It figures this failing company is now being driven right out of the stock market.

Anytime you try to buy out a company there could potentially be other bidders. While this one it appears initially that the LBO is the only option I wouldn't be surprised to see a company like CSCO get in on the action and try to take the company from M Dell. Though I'd assume that the CEO of CSCO would have to move after this since him and M Dell are neighbors. Another option could be Oracle to expand more into the SME area. The fun has just begun hold on kids.</Msg><Username>b_treml</Username><Timestamp>1359727264283</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 09:01:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359727287960-46</Id><Title>14 seem to be the line in the sand</Title><Msg>for NOW.</Msg><Username>a_big_farm_boy</Username><Timestamp>1359727287960</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 09:01:27 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359727745774-47</Id><Topic><Title>Usually A Buyout is in Stealth Mode.

Look at the 1 year chart and you will see the big drop from 15 in mid May, which probably prompted Dell to think about taking the company private. Anything less will make a lot of long term stock holders unhappy. I don't thnk Mr. Dell wants his reputation be ruined on the way out. Legacy, not money, is what in his mind, otherwise why bother going through all the trouble to take the company private.</Msg><Username>exwmci</Username><Timestamp>1359739479948</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:24:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359739697570-130</Id><Title>If you didnt buy under $13 there is still time to see $4 to up side.</Title><Msg>Relax $18 is coming.</Msg><Username>dw_home</Username><Timestamp>1359739697570</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 12:28:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359739985693-131</Id><Title>Dude on CNBC just said he sold Dell at 14 today......</Title><Msg>but what he didnt say he bought again at probably 13.7.

A deal could come as early as Monday, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Friday, cautioning that talks were ongoing and that the timetable could slip. Michael Dell is expected to take majority ownership of the Round Rock, Texas-based company, while private equity firm Silver Lake and giant software company Microsoft Corp would become minority investors, the people said. Dell did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Silver Lake and Microsoft declined to comment. The deal would mark the largest leveraged buyout since the global financial crisis. Going private would allow Dell, which has been trying to become a one-stop shop for corporate technology needs as the PC market shrinks, to carry out a challenging makeover away from public scrutiny.</Msg><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359742654657</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:17:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359742681340-160</Id><Title>REUTERS IN ON IT - RELEASE BS STORY JUST AFTER LUNCH STARTS ABOUT BUYOUT AT 13-14</Title><Msg>They release the story right after the small players go to lunch so they can take out their stop losses.

But I will wait and see.</Msg><Username>mr.phil2u</Username><Timestamp>1359742871946</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:21:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359742897696-164</Id><Topic><Title>Valuation premium of DELL acquisition</Title><Username>ae_savant</Username><Timestamp>1359733832712</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 10:50:32 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I would go with the higher one, but that's just me.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359742897696</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:21:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359743014683-165</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell in talks between $13-$14</Title><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359742654657</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:17:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>why is there no author attached to this reuters report???</Msg><Username>jj0850</Username><Timestamp>1359743014683</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:23:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359743016369-166</Id><Title>#$%$ us all over sucks that bs about buy to get poeple loss there money we are all #$%$ now sold at big loss sucks</Title><Msg>#$%$ dell</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1359743016369</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:23:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359743029427-167</Id><Topic><Title>Michael Dell in talks between $13-$14</Title><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359742654657</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:17:34 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>so theres no premium ?</Msg><Username>jk4763</Username><Timestamp>1359743029427</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:23:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359743044655-168</Id><Topic><Title>Forbes says $15-16</Title><Username>l4l85</Username><Timestamp>1359742406138</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:13:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Barrons's said DELL was worth $20-$25.

Just because you (or anybody else) bought some DELL shares at $12.50 or higher after rumors pushed the stock price up above it's $10.50 trading range, doesn't mean you made a smart buy. And just because some stock holders keep leaking "$15 is the price" to sleazy news outlets, doesn't make it a fact. I fully expect DELL stock to close today at or around $13. If there is a buyout pending, which is questionable, the price will likely be about $12.50.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1359743316920</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:28:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359743329097-176</Id><Title>HUGE SHORT POSITION TAKEN JUST BEFORE FAKE 13-14 STORY RELEASED</Title><Msg>Look at timing of large short position vs fake story release dont get played be the player 15 is price with 1 special dividend</Msg><Username>xohorsemen</Username><Timestamp>1359743329097</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:28:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359743352048-177</Id><Topic><Title>sold out loss #$%$ you all never see 1400 again todat in was all bull shi..#$%$.. you all sold at big #$%$ you</Title><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1359743285252</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:28:05 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>GOOD, please move on, I'm tired of using my secret decoder ring to figure out what you're saying.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359743352048</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:29:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359743364976-178</Id><Title>SELLLLLL!

Let's not forget they were already in talks when DELL was around $10.50 or so per share. Then the story purposely was leaked around the $10.88 mark in order to attract potential bidders or finance guys (to boost the price or close the deal). I'm guessing a 30-35% premium at the time of the plumbing problem (purposely leaked). Let's assume $10.88 times 1.30 or 1.35 multiple would equal precisely $14.14 to $14.68 per share.

A deal could come as early as Monday, people familiar with the matter told Reuters earlier on Friday, cautioning that talks were ongoing and that the timetable could slip. Michael Dell is expected to take majority ownership of the Round Rock, Texas-based company, while private equity firm Silver Lake and giant software company Microsoft Corp would become minority investors, the people said. Dell did not immediately respond to a request for comment, while Silver Lake and Microsoft declined to comment. The deal would mark the largest leveraged buyout since the global financial crisis. Going private would allow Dell, which has been trying to become a one-stop shop for corporate technology needs as the PC market shrinks, to carry out a challenging makeover away from public scrutiny</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1359745424920</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:03:44 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359745490063-218</Id><Topic><Title>Getting walked down... will close strong when they cover</Title><Username>l4l85</Username><Timestamp>1359744675574</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:51:15 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>im thinking close 13.80ish... will be a nice power hour for sure</Msg><Username>l4l85</Username><Timestamp>1359745490063</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:04:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359745567780-219</Id><Title>Short Position, and is huge ?</Title><Msg>Where to check that out?</Msg><Username>sharp_trader_007</Username><Timestamp>1359745567780</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:06:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359745651280-220</Id><Topic><Title>Short Position, and is huge ?</Title><Username>sharp_trader_007</Username><Timestamp>1359745567780</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:06:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>1/15/2013 57,365,649 44,800,215 1.280477 12/31/2012 61,350,767 15,092,545 4.064972 12/14/2012 65,864,388 26,582,716 2.477715 11/30/2012 72,960,454 26,621,917 2.740616 11/15/2012 57,644,332 23,864,679 2.415466 10/31/2012 51,714,254 15,297,810 3.380500 10/15/2012 48,528,144 21,102,254 2.299666 9/28/2012 47,385,954 18,497,642 2.561729 9/14/2012 50,442,433 19,019,119 2.652196 8/31/2012 51,627,508 23,737,424 2.174941 8/15/2012 45,054,061 14,362,165 3.136996 7/31/2012 44,032,503 18,175,242 2.422664 7/13/2012 51,913,904 14,442,880 3.594429 6/29/2012 52,021,444 23,847,699 2.181403 6/15/2012 57,888,760 20,929,178 2.765936 5/31/2012 65,302,917 29,752,995 2.194835 5/15/2012 66,634,933 14,001,402 4.759161 4/30/2012 65,252,107 12,993,340 5.021966 4/13/2012 67,387,218 16,067,222 4.194080 3/30/2012 71,702,872 17,580,692 4.078501 3/15/2012 63,390,497 15,394,332 4.117782 2/29/2012 63,173,306 26,512,803 2.382747 2/15/2012 69,517,855 18,889,857 3.680168 Read more: http://www.nasdaq.com/symbol/dell/short-interest#ixzz2JfyUwnHV</Msg><Username>eurotyle</Username><Timestamp>1359745651280</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:07:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359745699204-221</Id><Topic><Title>IMPORTANT INFO - DELL</Title><Username>sandiedejongu655</Username><Timestamp>1359730456338</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 09:54:16 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So full of SPAM....</Msg><Username>lord_aambro</Username><Timestamp>1359745699204</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:08:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359745786536-222</Id><Topic><Title>Reuters Reports 14$ Offer, Meanwhile....</Title><Username>thethirdchimp</Username><Timestamp>1359744834574</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 13:53:54 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>thoughts: Microsoft wants this deal badly and will loan up to 3 billion; M.

Perhaps, the offer comes in @ $14 plus a "consideration" of $1 in special dividend. The combined $15 offer gets rejected; the game continues...LBO folks come back with a BFO offer of $15.50 plus the $1 dividend. The negotiation process is considered complete. Some shareholders would still be livid, but the worth of a lawsuit would be marginalized. Still likely, but a difficult path to recapture the true value of DELL shares. Unless, of course, there is outside interest that surfaces. At that point the game continues. There are too many shareholders that would vote against a buyout less than $15...me included.

Once the rumors started, and the DELl share price went up from its recent $10 trading price, people bought in at $12.50 or higher. Those people who bought in late must realize they came late to the party, they missed the move higher.. Now whining and crying about it makes them look like amateurs. If there is a a buyout I expect it would be at around $12.50 per share, which is a very nice premium above the pre-rumor DELL trading price. The "$14 or higher" or "special dividend" posts around here are nothing more than people late to the stock crying because they did not buy DELl at $9 to $10 per share, where it sat for the past half a year. Michael Dell or a prviate equity partner is not going to overpay just because some greedy fools on a Yahoo message board think he should.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1359750074450</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 15:21:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359750098262-281</Id><Topic><Title>what happens if the deal closes at $13 a share on Monday?</Title><Username>johnny501us</Username><Timestamp>1359748308405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:51:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>i still have my shares(i want it to go to 18$), but the price was jack up fr like $10 b/c of the buyout.

I should know; I'm a Dell shareholder. Dell generated a whopping $3.5 billion in free cash flow in fiscal 2010. That's for a stock that costs $26 billion to buy. So my little piece of the company is generating a nice 13.46% internal rate of return on its cash flow. And that's assuming no growth from fiscal 2010's results. But wait, there's more. Dell has a $13.3 billion cash hoard. That's half the cost of the company! So let's assume for a second you were to buy the company, pay off all of Dell's debt, and then pocket any remaining cash. In that case, the business costs you not $26 billion, but $19 billion. So now you have a business that generates $3.6 billion (after interest expense savings) but costs only $19.2 billion to acquire. That's an 18.75% IRR ... and again assuming no growth or cost savings from the merger. You're gonna pay Let's be honest, Mr. Ellison. I have something you want. As a Dell shareholder, I'm not going to let that 18.75% go without a fight ... or a sizable takeover premium. And since Michael Dell, who owns 12% of the company, is likely to vote down any takeover, the premium offered to shareholders better be big ... possibly even 100%. A 100% takeover premium, or $27.10 per share, would take your annual return from 18.75% down to 8.15%. Assuming you and Hurd can grow Dell at a conservative 3%, that's still an 11.31% return even with an onerous takeover premium. And with your strong balance sheet, the cost of financing the transaction will be far less than the 11.31% received, so Oracle shareholders go home happy. And here's the kicker: The value mavens at Southeastern Asset Management are the single largest shareholder of Dell (at 7%) after Michael Dell. If you recall, Mr. Ellison, they were the single largest shareholder of Sun Microsystems when you bought Sun, too, and they were supportive of that deal.</Msg><Username>b_treml</Username><Timestamp>1359751056777</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 15:37:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359751134430-286</Id><Topic><Title>what happens if the deal closes at $13 a share on Monday?</Title><Username>johnny501us</Username><Timestamp>1359748308405</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 14:51:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>First off, $13 would be at the high end of a DELL buyout.

But since news of a pending buyout leaked Dell and ts partners may now have to pay more, for example, a minimum of $12. In no way is Dell responsible for the reckless sleazy media which tosses out numbers like $13, and $14. The fact DELL stock price has been bid up artifically high here at $13.50 is not Dell's fault and the company may not be held responsible for unreasonale, false expectations which some stock traders may have.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1359757074085</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 17:17:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359757914706-324</Id><Topic><Title>First deal is not necessarily the final deal</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359754308804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:31:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Silver lake agrees to $15.

The leak was on purpose to feel out the market. Your sour grapes and short position are obvious. Anyone that thinks a buyout would go through at 11 or even 12 is either HIGH, STUPID, or SHORT. Dell was trading at or about $11 when the talk started. You have mega funds holding this stock, most probably with HIGHER buy ins, they simply wouldn't agree to a 10 or 20% premium off the BOTTOM. You are either CLUELESS or SHORT, either way you are wasteing your breath here. Cry all you want, this thing is going to START at minimum $14.50 and I personally think will get done at $16 - $18.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359757951534</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 17:32:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359758084783-326</Id><Topic><Title>It Will Close $13 Get Ready!!

Michael Dell might own 16% but he does not own 50% so a new owner can control the company without Michael's help. My gut is; a low ball offer first ( around $15 ), follow by an outside offer of $17 or $18 and a final of $18.50, if we have the guts to hold out.</Msg><Username>ellerbebil2</Username><Timestamp>1359758281456</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 17:38:01 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359758321124-329</Id><Title>i love this stock i sold small loss but bought back at 1357pray for 15.ooto15.57 that my dreams shorts burn !!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>love mich dell I hate loss cover my stock I beleave min deal 1472 pray that help me!!help me jesus!</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1359758321124</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 17:38:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359758655438-330</Id><Topic><Title>First deal is not necessarily the final deal</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359754308804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:31:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You think "mega funds" have the authority to dictate price? Think again. Mega funds lose money all the time, buying stocks at too high a price and selling lower.Most mega funds annual returns are well below the market's major indexes. Mega funds can lose money buying/selling Dell stock just the same as you can . Mega funds have no "power" outside of their vote, which is irrelevant because Michael dell and his team have the majority ownership. You should probably buy mutual funds, fluteman, because the invidual stock stuff is confusing you and you will likely lose your money.

The relationship wherein one person has an obligation to act for another's benefit. A fiduciary relationship encompasses the idea of faith and confidence and is generally established only when the confidence given by one person is actually accepted by the other person. Mere respect for another individual's judgment or general trust in his or her character is ordinarily insufficient for the creation of a fiduciary relationship. The duties of a fiduciary include loyalty and reasonable care of the assets within custody. All of the fiduciary's actions are performed for the advantage of the beneficiary.</Msg><Username>jaykam10</Username><Timestamp>1359768345202</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 20:25:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359769692511-356</Id><Topic><Title>First deal is not necessarily the final deal</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359754308804</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 16:31:48 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Bashford, For the deal to get done you need 50.1% shareholder approval. Since the big funds have MILLIONS of shares, then YES they carry a lot of weight. Alone they don't but if you get enough shares to vote no this deal will not get done. FYI, Dell and company DONT have a majority, YET, what they do have for sure is 16% which is M. Dell's stake. How about you enlighten us as to how you arrive at " they have majority ownership ". Please post their exact ownership. I'm sure we won't be hearing from you again since you don't have a clue what you're talking about. I think you should clam up before I make you look like more of an idiot than you have already done. I have been doing this for over 30 years skippy so I won't be needing any of your silly advice. I hope this helps.</Msg><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1359769692511</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 20:48:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359771598939-357</Id><Title>what will M.

Fiduciary duty, insider trading, forcing shareholders to sell, while he is buying, and not to mention the CEO wants to pay a price far lower than what he directed the company to buy shares at.

Well it's creating nothing at all and in most cases the buy back just keeps the shares level since they are all giving away the same number in compensation. Either way it should be either dividend or plow back, nothing else. I'm not sure if they realize that buying back stock doesn't put money in shareholders pockets and the evidence shows that companies are just wasting money doing them.</Msg><Username>malona_1998</Username><Timestamp>1359781152313</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-02-01 23:59:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
