It seems he had planned to let the company suffer and drive the stock down in order to buy it at a the lowest price. Michael dell should be ashamed of himself.

There seems to be a few players who could benefit and get killed by Dell being bought out by a competitor. Microsoft would get hurt badly if Apple were to make a play for Dell. I think todays offer by M. Dell is just the 3rd or 4th inning of this thing. We get a garbage offer today my Mike and then the competition will look hard at this. You can buy Dell right now for a little under $10 a share which is current price less the net cash you get in the deal. So you can buy a company making 2.5B a year for 10 billion.

All of the Company's stations broadcast primary channels that are affiliated with major networks. In addition to the primary channels, the majority of Gray's stations also broadcast secondary digital channels that are affiliated with various networks.

Instead, through litigation law firms will be allowed to do a discovery process. The lawyers are after settlement fees, which are paid by the insurance companies representing the involved company's. in a deal like this a dozen law firms will share about $2 million worth of settlement fees. Actually, Dell, silverlake, Microsoft, banks etc.... want the lawsuits because it gives the LBO credibility and protects it from future litigation.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360080805279</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:13:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360080817002-261</Id><Title>look at feb 1 sad day wish never got up wish this stock rallyed 14 plus like bbry</Title><Msg>sh!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1360080817002</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:13:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360080875327-262</Id><Title>TAKING MY MONEY AND HEADING TO HPQ WHICH IS SELLING AT A 70% DISCOUNT.</Title><Msg>Dell is now played out and dead money, goodby.</Msg><Username>wildbill400</Username><Timestamp>1360080875327</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:14:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360080903117-263</Id><Topic><Title>expect lots of lawsuits over the next several days</Title><Username>ny_scam_exchange</Username><Timestamp>1360075973771</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 09:52:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your logic is totally flawed.</Msg><Username>chinookcook2000</Username><Timestamp>1360080903117</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:15:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360081080553-264</Id><Topic><Title>What the heck paid 13.79</Title><Username>chinookcook2000</Username><Timestamp>1360075807777</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 09:50:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>which one the one under another alias?</Msg><Username>chinookcook2000</Username><Timestamp>1360081080553</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:18:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360081249053-265</Id><Title>dell is great man stockholder and option are at loss now need 1410</Title><Msg>sucks</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1360081249053</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:20:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360081251474-266</Id><Topic><Title>What the heck paid 13.79</Title><Username>chinookcook2000</Username><Timestamp>1360075807777</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 09:50:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I suspect there will be a special dividend, at least $1.00 to sweeten the pot.

SEC Expands Probe On Executive Trades By Susan Pulliam | The Wall Street Journal – 12 hours ago.. . . The Securities and Exchange Commission, expanding a high-profile investigation, is gathering data on a broad number of trades by corporate executives in shares of their own companies, according to people familiar with the probe. At issue is whether corporate executives are improperly taking advantage in their trading of access to private information about their businesses. Corporate executives, like all investors, are prohibited under securities laws from trading when they possess important, nonpublic information about their companies that can have an impact on the stock. The development comes on the heels of an article in The Wall Street Journal that highlighted well-timed and profitable trades by seven executives in shares of their own companies. Following the article, the SEC and Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into the seven examples and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office sent subpoenas to five of the seven companies. The new push by regulators goes beyond the seven companies named in the Journal article to a larger field of trades by executives. On Monday, one of those companies, VeriFone Systems Inc., said in a regulatory filing that the SEC and Manhattan U.S. attorney's office had notified the company that they had concluded their inquiries and that "no claim, action or other proceeding was asserted by either authority." The Journal article stemmed from an analysis of 20,000 government filings by executives over an eight-year period. Among the findings was that 1,418 executives who traded their company stock in the week before news was announced averaged gains of 10%—or avoided losses of 10%—within a week of their trades. The Journal analysis was based on a computer program the newspaper developed. The SEC is developing a similar computerized approach to analyze company-insider filings, a person familiar with the probe says. The article also exposed shortcomings of the regulations regarding corporate-insider trading, including loopholes in the rules that allow executives to trade even when they possess private knowledge about their companies if they establish preset trading arrangements, known as a 10b5-1 plans. Companies aren't required to disclose—even to the SEC—the existence, termination or changes to such plans. Investors, including the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds totaling more than $3 trillion in assets, petitioned the SEC after the Journal article to revamp the rules and provide better disclosure about such plans. "This is a significant expansion" of the probe, said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University, adding that the focus is increasing awareness of a "phenomenon that people have been talking about for a long time, and that is that executives have been abusing 10b5-1 plans and using them to provide a smoke screen for what would otherwise be labeled insider trading." The statement by VeriFone followed a presentation by the company to the SEC and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office in which it argued that trading by Douglas Bergeron, VeriFone's CEO, was in compliance with the law. VeriFone previously said Mr. Bergeron always had traded through preset plans.</Msg><Username>zillionaire_investor</Username><Timestamp>1360081398265</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:23:18 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360081440866-269</Id><Title>why shorts buying love bbry dell stocks need stock buy back</Title><Msg>1470</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1360081440866</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 11:24:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360081607509-270</Id><Topic><Title>I've seen three law firms initiate investigations already</Title><Username>usa_republic52</Username><Timestamp>1360079303805</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 10:48:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Over the last few months they have been doing things to lower the stock price, not raise it.

He would get a majority stake in his company as part of the leveraged buyout. As a result, the view of the company’s second largest shareholder, Southeastern Asset Management, could play an important role. The money manager has about a 7.5% stake in Dell. A person familiar with the matter says Southeastern is worried that Michael Dell could be getting his company on the cheap. I like were this is potentially going.

The lawsuits will just be sabre rattling to extract a slighlty higher price. If the dissident shareholders make too strong a case the deal is off and the stock goes back below $10. A competing bid is unlikely due to the current ownership stake by Mr. Dell. Silver Lake, MSFT and banks are not rookies to htis kind of thing. They would not have offered 13.65 if they did not think it would go through. Personally I was hoping for more but I intend to take my loss and move on.

Overall, it seems that the odds are strong that this will indeed get done at $13.65, and thus it's not worth waiting many months for 25 cents. They will NOT sweeten the deal. Forget it. The only hope for longs now is if someone else makes a bid. Not something I would bet on. If any of these lawsuits gain traction, then one can revisit going long. Conversely, you could get a solid "HP making an offer" rumour and see this thing spike temporarily. To the posters who said it would trade higher than the offer price when the news was made official - as I said, you were wrong. Hopefully you learned something. Those who think that each and every one of the lawsuits that will be brought will be without merit might be sadly mistaken. Yes, there are always frivolous lawsuits in these types of deals. Agreed. Goes with the territory. However, this is a very special and unique situation. We shall see. Sold at a small profit (was in at $12.70 average). Was thinking $14.50 was a realistic figure, but it was not to be. That's life. Still have my currently worthless puts just in case something does go wrong.

LOL Seriously, you know he has to be thinking how much fun it would be to immediately up the price just to tweek M. Dell's and Steve Balmer's noses. They couldn't let him have it. Michael Dell would go from being the King to the Court Jester. What would Micheal Dell do with the rest of his life if someone bought the company out from under him. Come on Larry. Enjoy life. Make a offer tomorrow morning of $14.65 and I'll buy you a cold beer. If you offer $14.65 M.

And no other tech firm has wanted to acquire Dell. Michael Dell and his LBO team will now reorgranize the company, reposition it, and in the process suffer bottom line losses. Michael Dell did not want the company to suffer bottomline losses as a public company, because if that happened the DELL share price would trade at about $4 to $6 per share. It is time for this message board to get real, stop the nonsense posts by fool amateurs like fluteman, and appreciate that $13.65 is a very generous buyout price. The alternative is a single digit stock price for at least 4 to 5 years while the company suffers bottomline losses and repositions itself. No guarantee the reorganization will work, either, which is another reason to be grateful for todays $13.65 buyout deal. Hope this helps.</Msg><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360116465930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:07:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360117274896-491</Id><Topic><Title>it is time to get real</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360116465930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:07:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree with you......</Msg><Username>vincool</Username><Timestamp>1360117274896</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:21:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360117427796-492</Id><Topic><Title>it is time to get real</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360116465930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:07:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they're debt financing is less than 4x ebitda.... they will own the company debt free in about five years... total baloney... they're stealing it... ask Penza... ask Southeast... ask Deutsche Bank analyst ... it's a rip off and shareholders will whine and will vote no</Msg><Username>thethirdchimp</Username><Timestamp>1360117427796</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:23:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360118601683-493</Id><Topic><Title>it is time to get real</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360116465930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:07:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Go screw yourself BashTARD.

SEC expands probe on trading by executives: The Securities and Exchange Commission, expanding a high-profile investigation, is gathering data on a broad number of trades by corporate executives in shares of their own companies, according to people familiar with the probe. At issue is whether corporate executives are improperly taking advantage in their trading of access to private information about their businesses. Corporate executives, like all investors, are prohibited under securities laws from trading when they possess important, nonpublic information about their companies that can have an impact on the stock. The development comes on the heels of an article in The Wall Street Journal that highlighted well-timed and profitable trades by seven executives in shares of their own companies. Following the article, the SEC and Federal Bureau of Investigation began looking into the seven examples and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office sent subpoenas to five of the seven companies. The new push by regulators goes beyond the seven companies named in the Journal article to a larger field of trades by executives. On Monday, one of those companies, VeriFone Systems Inc., said in a regulatory filing that the SEC and Manhattan U.S. attorney's office had notified the company that they had concluded their inquiries and that "no claim, action or other proceeding was asserted by either authority." The Journal article stemmed from an analysis of 20,000 government filings by executives over an eight-year period. Among the findings was that 1,418 executives who traded their company stock in the week before news was announced averaged gains of 10%—or avoided losses of 10%—within a week of their trades. The Journal analysis was based on a computer program the newspaper developed. The SEC is developing a similar computerized approach to analyze company-insider filings, a person familiar with the probe says. The article also exposed shortcomings of the regulations regarding corporate-insider trading, including loopholes in the rules that allow executives to trade even when they possess private knowledge about their companies if they establish preset trading arrangements, known as a 10b5-1 plans. Companies aren't required to disclose—even to the SEC—the existence, termination or changes to such plans. Investors, including the Council of Institutional Investors, which represents pension funds totaling more than $3 trillion in assets, petitioned the SEC after the Journal article to revamp the rules and provide better disclosure about such plans. "This is a significant expansion" of the probe, said James Cox, a law professor at Duke University, adding that the focus is increasing awareness of a "phenomenon that people have been talking about for a long time, and that is that executives have been abusing 10b5-1 plans and using them to provide a smoke screen for what would otherwise be labeled insider trading." The statement by VeriFone followed a presentation by the company to the SEC and the Manhattan U.S. attorney's office in which it argued that trading by Douglas Bergeron, VeriFone's CEO, was in compliance with the law. VeriFone previously said Mr. Bergeron always had traded through preset plans.</Msg><Username>investor606</Username><Timestamp>1360119976463</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:06:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360120122920-501</Id><Title>IS MICHAEL DELL JEWISH?</Title><Msg>Could explain why he is trying to rip off shareholders</Msg><Username>sellbby</Username><Timestamp>1360120122920</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:08:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360120267469-502</Id><Topic><Title>IS MICHAEL DELL JEWISH?</Title><Username>sellbby</Username><Timestamp>1360120122920</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:08:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>loser</Msg><Username>eliapostchild</Username><Timestamp>1360120267469</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:11:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360120388479-503</Id><Topic><Title>It's time for Bashford to learn how the markets work</Title><Username>fluteman_greg</Username><Timestamp>1360118785211</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:46:25 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>put him on 'ignore'. save your sanity.</Msg><Username>eliapostchild</Username><Timestamp>1360120388479</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:13:08 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360120800289-504</Id><Title>So what happens to my shares if it goes private?</Title><Msg>Does this mean Michael Dell is buying all the shares back.... at what price?</Msg><Username>major_kudos</Username><Timestamp>1360120800289</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 22:20:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1360121165257-505</Id><Topic><Title>it is time to get real</Title><Username>bashfordcapital</Username><Timestamp>1360116465930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 21:07:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I agree.

It is all about the future ipo. If dell and his cronies wanted more shares, they could have bought them at 10. But he wants the ipo so he and his wall street buddies can totally set the price for the new ipo Your theory is garbage. If he were worried about losses and a low stock price, he would not buy it or he could wait for that $4 stock price you are babbling about. But I will give you credit on one thing and one thing only: you correctly predicted the BOD would rubber stamp anything Dell wanted. Others thought the BOD would insist on a higher price. You correctly pointed out that the BOD is hand picked by Dell and they would not oppose him.</Msg><Username>zillionaire_investor</Username><Timestamp>1360124229574</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 23:17:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360124772131-516</Id><Title>$24.4 BILLION = $14 A SHARES = AS INSIDE INFO KNEW IT ALL ALONG</Title><Msg>Just look at $14 for last 2-3 weeks they were worth jack crap.... another example of how the crook wall street operates</Msg><Username>gobal_warning</Username><Timestamp>1360124772131</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-02-05 23:26:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1360124901201-517</Id><Title>jewish</Title><Msg>yea he is.

Intel is going to have lots of competition moving forward. Moving forward, windows will no longer be under intel domination. Windows will run ARM processors, ie, Qualcomm, TI, and many more.
