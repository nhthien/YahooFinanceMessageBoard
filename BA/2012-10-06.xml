Mitt Romney traveled to Asia to sign up first wave investors for Bain Capital in 1984! He specifically stated he would help these Asian countries to pressure US corporations to outsource manufacturing jobs to Taiwan/China and other Asian countries as an exchange for these nations to invest in his Bain Capital! He sold out Americans! That is why the jobs in big companies went to Asia! We still have the new clips to show he joined then dictators in Taiwan and China to invite them to invest foreign exchange reserve money $20 billions in Bain Capital! That is why Mitt Romney has a house in Cayman Island, so do Taiwan and China government foreign exchange reserve managers also have houses in Cayman Island! Today, Chinese Communist party has $200 billions investment in US corp. from Cayman Island and Taiwan has $150 billions investment in US corp. from Cayman Island! They want to make sure US corporations keep outsource to Taiwan and China!</Msg><Username>savvy_investor123</Username><Timestamp>1349500534072</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 01:15:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349513388349-4</Id><Title>Obama to Wear Elevator Shoes During Next Debate....</Title><Msg>to show he's heads above Romney!</Msg><Username>mike_2face</Username><Timestamp>1349513388349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 04:49:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349516296067-5</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to Wear Elevator Shoes During Next Debate....</Title><Username>mike_2face</Username><Timestamp>1349513388349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 04:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>All Obama needs to do to show he's heads above Willtard is to call him on his countless lies.</Msg><Username>proud_2bn_atheist</Username><Timestamp>1349516296067</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 05:38:16 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349517891486-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to Wear Elevator Shoes During Next Debate....</Title><Username>mike_2face</Username><Timestamp>1349513388349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 04:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>and you're a countless idiot..............</Msg><Username>alangonquin11</Username><Timestamp>1349517891486</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:04:51 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>11</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349520791200-7</Id><Topic><Title>Obama to Wear Elevator Shoes During Next Debate....</Title><Username>mike_2face</Username><Timestamp>1349513388349</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 04:49:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You sound like you need to get laid.</Msg><Username>monster_scrotum</Username><Timestamp>1349520791200</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 06:53:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349536916740-8</Id><Title>Boeing loser by 3.35% on the year, Dow up 11.4%,apple still up 61% for the year</Title><Msg>Congratulations all you Boeing shareholders while the worst average Dow jones is up over 11% the one stock that you picked to own of what 30 Dow Jones stocks after a great week up is still cositng you over 3% for the first 10 months of 2012, while buying the Dow Jones average would have made you over 11% return, better than a bond for sure. and apple which is falling like a rock now is still a 61% gain for the year. so on $100,000 you now have 97000 in boeing , $110,000 in the Dow or $161000 if you purchased apple at the strat fo the year.

The poll by Florida research firm Gravis Marketing of likely Colorado voters, conducted Oct. 3-4, shows Republican Romney favored by 49.4 percent and Democrat Obama by 45.9 percent, a difference of 3.5 percentage points. It's a reversal of the result of Gravis' latest pre-debate poll of Coloradans, conducted Sept. 25, that showed a 4.7-point advantage for Obama. Obama and Romney debated at DU on Oct. 3, but Gravis said it conducted its most recent survey after the debate. Most pundits have said the felt Romney prevailed over Obama in the faceoff, their first of three scheduled debates.</Msg><Username>imaccom</Username><Timestamp>1349557622625</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 17:07:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349557665875-21</Id><Topic><Title>why was it that Obama stopped drilling on Government Lands?
