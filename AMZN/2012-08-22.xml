And, I will predict now that by this time next year, not only will AMZN have fallen through the floor, but you will have a class action (with a strong chance of success because AMZN does have the internal data and it is why they are trying to force smaller retailers to collect tax) for Amazon not disclosing the magnitude of the difference between sales in states without tax versus with it.

Understand that long only funds cannot reverse and go short like you. They have a fiduciary obligation to shareholders and a material change to the Amazon consumer value proposition is in sight at this point. As I've said and will continue to say, if it was advantageous for AMZN to go bricks and mortar, it could have/would have done it sooner. Those long only funds cannot profit from a stock's drop. All they can do is try to anchor other funds and retail investors on an artificially high price (behavorial investing) and let it go from there.

The challenge of course, is that when it reverses, it hit hard (see Facebook, which IMHO will be more valuable than AMZN long term because of its ease increasing returns to scale -- true network effects -- global scale, global currency hedge, especially when it turns on social commerce...). AMZN will actually be facing a LOT of negative PR soon enough. It did leverage DOJ in the anti-trust play against AAPL, when in reality in eBooks, it was AMZN that should have been investigated. Apple will bring it to trial and discovery will, in all likelihood, turn up some ugly internal docs, just as it did for GOOG in the ORCL trial. Who knows, it may even turn up some emails on the MSFA strategy designed to inhibit competition from etailers now that AMZN no longer can benefit from the subsidy. When AMZN's true strategy and motivations become clear, it will have a PR debacle on its hands. But, it will take awhile for all this to play out.

So we'll see. I think that's what it would take: not anyting AMZN specific b/c AMZN is supported at the highest levels of our society.
