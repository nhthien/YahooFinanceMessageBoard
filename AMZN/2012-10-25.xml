The streets are littered with bodies of investors that were correct in their analysis and yet the market killed them. I believe Amazon, at these levels is one of those. Most of the shorts have been beaten up and are staying away from a stock that appears to me grossly overpriced. I shorted a bit at 248 and lost money when it went beyond 260. When it dropped below 240 I doubled my short. Just as investors who were long for a lengthy time are emboldened even when the market takes the stock higher than seems reasonable. People who are short, get braver (me) the further it drops. If Amazon doubled their profits this year, it would be insignificant and would barely budge the stock. If their profits fell in half, it would scare a lot of the people away from the stock. This is the first company that I have ever shorted. I've lost money on good bets in the past. I think this is a good bet to short Amazon. Until I see more profits from Amazon, irregardless of the price, I'm going short.

Online sales is not a poor business model. It's just silly to think that AMZN has higher overhead than brick and mortar retailers. The huge infrastructure spend is the drag on profits. I know Amazon well as vendor and know they are much sharper retailer than a year ago today. They automate chargebacks and take huge ad allowances. These are massive profits centers for retailers that they never touched before. I foresee this having a very large impact on the bottom line this quarter and am calling for an upside surprise. I think the 50k people they are hiring for Q4 is also a really good sign that Q4 will remain strong.</Msg><Username>beauty90210211</Username><Timestamp>1351169882751</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 08:58:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351170173515-20</Id><Topic><Title>Buying call options today easy money</Title><Username>herzigr</Username><Timestamp>1351168909326</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 08:41:49 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I truly hope you are right.

But my 401K fund manager is probably using our money to picking up shares right now.</Msg><Username>howo3579</Username><Timestamp>1351196304850</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:18:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351196306134-298</Id><Topic><Title>Just Sold My Beach Home &amp; Quadrupled Down On AMZN</Title><Username>stanbursts</Username><Timestamp>1351182278505</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 12:24:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>This one? http://www.google.com/imgres?start=517&amp;hl=en&amp;biw=1440&amp;bih=809&amp;tbm=isch&amp;tbnid=UJZgJ8r7ykMxCM:&amp;imgrefurl=http://www.philly.com/philly/blogs/downashore%3Fmain%3D%26cat%3D%26month%3D%26year%3D%26page%3D11&amp;docid=Xmrb-zUz-lNL8M&amp;imgurl=http://media.philly.com/images/lbishack.jpg&amp;w=2048&amp;h=1536&amp;ei=VJ6JUPftL_PG0AHMxIDYBw&amp;zoom=1&amp;iact=hc&amp;vpx=909&amp;vpy=103&amp;dur=7&amp;hovh=194&amp;hovw=259&amp;tx=156&amp;ty=137&amp;sig=102897956108907077659&amp;page=16&amp;tbnh=149&amp;tbnw=210&amp;ndsp=41&amp;ved=1t:429,r:35,s:500,i:109</Msg><Username>wobatus</Username><Timestamp>1351196306134</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:18:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351196315647-299</Id><Topic><Title>BEZOS better have a good answer to his stock crashing..people are getting sick of this pos</Title><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1351195693042</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very BULISH bounce here..wouljdnt doubt 225 tomorrow</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1351196315647</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:18:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351196341848-300</Id><Topic><Title>Raising GUIDANCE!!!!! .64-.70 NEXT QTR</Title><Username>wingofeaglets</Username><Timestamp>1351196178685</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:16:18 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The CC hasn't started, so it is pure fiction from a desperate long.</Msg><Username>ex.goldbug</Username><Timestamp>1351196341848</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:19:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351196344815-301</Id><Topic><Title>Quote: We are taking share from Walmart, other Big Box.</Title><Username>wingofeaglets</Username><Timestamp>1351196101498</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:15:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>YEAH YOUR MOMMAS BIG BOX!!!!!</Msg><Username>spyeman</Username><Timestamp>1351196344815</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:19:04 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351196350229-302</Id><Topic><Title>$170 --ish Tomorrrow</Title><Username>housedoctor66</Username><Timestamp>1351195602057</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:06:42 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ish,,,,</Msg><Username>housedoctor66</Username><Timestamp>1351196350229</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:19:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351196357316-303</Id><Title>buy on the dips</Title><Msg>last chance tomorrow.......</Msg><Username>melodias23</Username><Timestamp>1351196357316</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:19:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351196357412-304</Id><Title>buy on the dips</Title><Msg>last chance tomorrow.......</Msg><Username>melodias23</Username><Timestamp>1351196357412</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:19:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351196380450-305</Id><Topic><Title>robyn nice call on 210/220 put spread.</Title><Username>blues_mann</Username><Timestamp>1351196021407</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:13:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Not to mention ditm Jan puts chaching.

My bad luck again this time. If it stays closer to $220 in the AH, I will close my position. Last time I got burned with this stock going back to $240 the next day. Bad memory , but deja-vu again.

We did that to our competition by undercutting price too. It does work, but now we have a clientele that will leave if we adjust more than 5% annually. It is going to take us a while to get to 30% margins. Luckily a bulk of our costs are not tied to inflation. Amazon might be just as lucky. They hire people and wages are staying low. So they are taking advantage of a bad economy. My thought is that amazon may get to be massive by being cheap, but it may never get to be profitable like apple. But then I see them expanding in new higher margin areas. And I realize they may be more like IBM. And get out of hardware and make their money on services. Amazon may sell goods, but they don't earn money doing it.

All I know is that I will be buying $50-100K worth of LT puts over the next few days if they keep it here or try to squeeze it up. We are JUST STARTING to get the bad news for Amazon. The reason Amazon is trying to avoid collecting taxes on the "Fulfilled by Amazon" stuff in California is that it knows tax collection is hitting it. Google will shortly announce much more competition on the content front. Amazon has made many very poor strategic decisions. Amazon simply is not well equipped to capture value. Its FCF yield is embarrassing. Any institutional long not distributing at these levels facing this competitive landscape is negligent. At 200, this is more overvalued than CMG was at 450. That got cut in half. If Amazon is lucky and we do not have another financial shock, it should get cut in half. If there is a financial shock and vendors stop financing Amazon through negative working capital, Amazon could easily become insolvent.

Which is why I use the system that I do. It allows me to earn supranormal returns as the stock gets overly stretched... I often "lose" money as the predatory games move against me, but unlike you and most "investors" these days, I have a solid reference point for sustainable economic value capture and thus stock price. So, when it moves against me, I act like an investor and buy more. When it moves massively in my favor, I take some profit UNLESS, as is the case in this earnings report, all of my hypothesis are validated. In which case I let it all ride and add even more on any move against me. I don't gamble. I understand both the economy and the competitive dynamics affecting AMZN better than 99% of those holding this stock.

I will be adding A LOT tomorrow if it stays in these ranges or goes up. The institutional longs know that allowing these games to continue is what is leading so much money to pull out of the market. Less AUM means lower fees means fewer people, more competition and less compensation. At some point, they are going to decide to stop protecting that which cannot be protected. Amazon is engaged in such wild malinvestment and has picked so many battles it cannot win that it will be headed below $100. The only question is whether people can stay in the game that long.

All of the technical indicators I look at are oversold. Not to say they can't go even more, but AMZN is both a cartel controlled stock and the poster child for the post bubble Bernanke economy. But, I also firmly believe that distribution has begun. The cartel simply can't perpetrate the scam forever, if for no other reason than their antics are being noticed even by the clueless longs. Soros getting out last year was the first shot across the bow, and I believe your holdings data may be the second, albeit small flows for now. Third, AMZN has really been the buyer of their own stock for the last two years, along with the cartel HFT machines, and they have been financing this stock buying through their own cash flow. Even AMZN now admits that their cash flow is negative, and likely to get worse in the coming quarters. Less cash, less stock buying. Maybe even a forced debt offering coming in the next 4 quarters. Finally, the biggest driver of AMZN's valuation and the HFT cartel scam has been the FED easy money policy, near infinite money printing, handed mostly to the cartel controlled banks (GS and others). While the FED is still printing an excess 40 billion a month, I believe the market is just now pricing in a Romney victory. While this may have some economic impact at the margin, a Romney victory is certain to end the reign of Bernanke. Probably by this December. The markets are not pricing in that, but are just beginning to. No more Bernanke, much less easy money. Maybe the end of QE Forever. And that is a huge blow not just to AMZN, but all stocks, AAPL included. Conclusion: AMZN rallies a bit tomorrow and maybe even up to 240 over the next few days. Then more selling. And this time, in larger chunks.</Msg><Username>chl94611</Username><Timestamp>1351213438210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 21:03:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351213925284-590</Id><Title>Two minutes before close down 6 dollars, WHY?</Title><Msg>Did earning news LEAK</Msg><Username>ramsun777</Username><Timestamp>1351213925284</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 21:12:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351214066325-591</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN Rally Tomorrow, Then The Long Slide Begins</Title><Username>chl94611</Username><Timestamp>1351213438210</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 21:03:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>maybe based on comps.

Media revenue grew 8% to 2.25 billion or 12% excluding foreign exchange. And EGM revenue grew 34% to 3.22 billion or 42% excluding foreign exchange. EGM now represents 59% of international revenues up from 53%. International segment operating income decreased 91% to 16 million or 0.3% operating margin. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange, international segment operating income decreased 74%. Consolidated segment operating income decreased 7% to 360 million or 2.8% of revenue down approximately 109 basis points year-over-year. Excluding the unfavorable impact from foreign exchange CSOI decreased 4%. Unlike CSOI, our GAAP operating income includes stock based compensation expense and other operating expense. GAAP operating income decreased 47% to $107 million or 0.8% of net sales. Our income tax expense was $109 million a 75% effective tax rate for the quarter and includes a one-time expense of $51 million related to the integration of Kiva Systems acquisition. Accordingly, our Q2 2012 effective tax rate is higher than both our current estimated 2012 annual effective rate and our 2011 effective tax rate. GAAP net income was $7 million or $0.01 per diluted share compared with $191 million and $0.41 per diluted share. Q2 2012 net income includes $65 million of estimated loss related to the acquisition and integration of Kiva Systems. Turning to the balance sheet. Cash and marketable securities decreased 1.39 billion year-over-year to 4.97 billion. Inventory increased 36% to 4.3 billion and inventory turns were 10.1 down from 11.3 turns a year ago as we expanded selection, improved in stock levels and introduced new product categories. Accounts payable increased 24% to 7.07 billion and accounts payable days decreased to 68 from 69 in the prior year.

Incorporated into our guidance are the order trends that we have seen to-date and what we believe today to be properly conservative assumptions. Our results are inherently unpredictable and maybe materially affected by many factors including a high level of uncertainties surrounding exchange rate fluctuations as well as the global economy consumer spending. It's not possible to accurately predict demand and therefore, our actual results could differ materially from our guidance. As we describe in more detail in our public filings, issues such as settling intercompany balances and foreign currencies among such subsidiaries, unfavorable resolution of legal matters, and changes to our effective tax rate can all have a material effect on guidance. Our guidance further assumes that we don’t conclude any additional business acquisition, investments or settlement, record any further revision for stock-based compensation estimates, and that foreign exchange rates remain approximately where they have been recently. For the Q3 2012 we expect net sales of between 12.9 and 14.3 billion or growth between 19 and 31%. This guidance anticipates approximately 425 basis points of unfavorable impact from foreign exchange rates. GAAP operating income or loss to be between 350 million loss and 50 million loss down from 79 million income in the comparable prior year period. This includes approximately $275 million for stock-based compensation and amortization of intangible assets. We anticipate consolidated segment operating income or loss which excludes stock-based compensation and other operating expenses to be between $75 million loss and $225 million in income, or between a 129% decline and 14% decline. We expect capital expenditures including capitalized software development to be approximately $0.8 billion to $0.9 billion. These anticipated investments are driven primarily by our expectations of a continued business growth consisting of investments in technology infrastructure, including Amazon web service and additional capacity to support our fulfillment operations. We remain heads on focused on driving better customer experience through price, selection and convenience. We believe putting customers first is the only reliable way to create lasting value for shareholder. Thanks. With that, Sean, we will move to questions.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1351214195826</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 21:16:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351214745956-595</Id><Topic><Title>THIS SI YOUR SCAMAZON FRAUD IN USA: HANG $UCKING FRAUD STREET BANKSTERS/SE.C.

Don't you see this stock, just like all other stocks, is 200% controlled? (I say 200% because the manipulators move stock both up and down.) Do you really think the plunge or shooting up "immediately" after the release of earnings data is due to various "investors" reading the data, deciding whether to buy or sell, and placing their orders within a nanosecond of the release of the data? Come on, wake up. where the price moves is determined by them before the release of the data.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351215691825</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 21:41:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351215914720-602</Id><Topic><Title>Sybil may be able to get out unscathed tomorrow.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1351196910895</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 16:28:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes it hit 205, and yes you missed somthing ...

With that, i will make a short term prediction. Although the market is wobbly and has spooked the bulls, Most of this downturn is over. Apple is within $30 of its 200 dma, which should hold. We'll then get a Santa Claus rally. There will be some pretty sharp bear market rallies that will wipe out the weak bears bears (like me). I will use these rallies to get out of some long positions.
