Amazon is launching yet another product! The Amazon version of the Roku will surely have the same impact or more as the Kindle and the Kindle Fire. Since we don't know exactly how many of those have been sold we'll just be pumped knowing that it's "a lot" and we'll jump the stock every time it "sells out" and when it reaches the top of the Amazon sales charts. Phew I was starting to wonder what would be the catalyst that marks the potential for future growth this quarter.</Msg><Username>jcosurvey</Username><Timestamp>1366867073676</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 01:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366867856754-2</Id><Topic><Title>More Bezos Nonsense</Title><Username>bbyboomer50</Username><Timestamp>1366847254633</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-24 19:47:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Great post!

I'm long AMZN and a firm believer in their strategy, but they're not Berkshire. Of course I understand that splits do nothing to value. However, I'm banking on the fact that joe public doesn't know or doesn't care. He'll buy it back up anyway.

The cartel wants it up so if the market behaves they'll be trying to lure in buyers. The mid point of revenue guidance is $15.35M which amounts to 19.6% growth. Nice growth but the growth she is slowing, time to start selling more stuff at or below cost. It's up in after hours after the usual initial plunge. It the markets good it will be up tomorrow as the cartel will say, never mind that growth is slowing BUY, BUY, BUY. Of course their might be a few rogue analysts who leave the family and speak their mind on the slowing growth story and lack of significant cash flow given the valuation.</Msg><Username>hapihammer</Username><Timestamp>1366921899327</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 16:31:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366921908129-292</Id><Title>look again</Title><Msg>growing sales of digital content, cloud-computing services and gains in its main retail business.

Investors strongly believe in Jeff Bezos, as opposed to, say, Tim Cook of apple. And Amazon is really a collection of a few big businesses under one roof and each business lines are leading segments in the industry they compete in. When you look at apple, it is just smart phones. When you look at Walmart, it is just distributor of goods. When you look at at say EQIX, a leading cloud storage computing company, and NFLX, a media content provider - Amazon is a collection of all these businesses under one umbrella, so investors believe Jeff Bezos will hit a few home runs in the long run. Crazy valuation, I agree and that is the only way I can see why people buy at 1000x PE.</Msg><Username>idbtc</Username><Timestamp>1366923791764</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 17:03:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366923828928-378</Id><Topic><Title>Earnings Drop - AMZN goes up - The Emperor Has NO Clothes</Title><Username>flighttoquality9</Username><Timestamp>1366922662785</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 16:44:22 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Here's my take; Amzn did dump 1000's of kindles on the market to take USE away from say AAPL. They expand their online digital content, so they can compete with NFLX and AAPL and Barnes n Noble/Borbders...so far Borders is gone, Barnes is close, and with the improved watching content NFLX may take a hit, but more Kindles or a set-top box is needed. AMZN music is better in my opinion to AAPL's store, but like AAPL, getting people hooked is a long and hard road. Once AMZN gets people hooked...the profit margins on Dig.Content is HUGE, so the current multiple on this company is with that expectation drive revenue and earnings, will it happen one day? who knows? Sure AMZN doesn't make much margin on the physical #$%$ they sell,...but for the market place sellers, they make 15-25% on every transaction. 15-25% for doing nothing but letting people sell their own #$%$! Plus, those sellers can store their #$%$ at AMZN (for a fee)...AMZN has already created the warehousing for their own stuff so they're getting paid to store their own stuff. All-in-all, AMZN is making money with the HOPE that one day this magic switch is flicked and they then traunce their competitors because of all the future use anticipation, the big question is how long, and will that switch ever get flipped!

As someone who has worked in customer service I agree but price has a lot to do with the consumer also as has and will pricing pressure. It can be all about the customer but as an investor in NON GREATER FOOL STOCKS it's also all about fundamentals, cash flow, EPS, margins and not BS. This CFO is doing a good job answering questions but perhaps the gang of thieves is going to turn on the golden goose? Maybe maybe not.

I encourage all of you who are independent investors to look at fulfillment and gross shipping cost as a percent of net sales compared to Q4. They grew.

They decided to get greedy and squeeze those who believe in fundamentals on both sides. In the process, they've killed trust and increased fragility by an order of magnitude. There is only 1 stable path out of all of this where the markets don't completely break down within the next 3 months. They appear to be unwilling to make that play.

WS has been able to convince the sheep that AMZN is a great investment, once everyone realizes it's not, it will fall like GMCR from 100. It amazes me that the "policing" dept. of our government allow this to go on. They are either stupid or in cahoots. I was pondering the other day... Before the internet the only way to invest was through a brokerage house. They skimmed 5% right off the top regardless of results. Then came Etrade/TDAmeritrade/ScottsTrade and WS lost its golden goose. With all these games and scams, it's like there is a group effort to screw the retail investor until we all just give up and go back to mutual funds and money managers. If you ever talk to any of those guys (even friends) they all spew the same lines and are oblivious to all that is going on!? Am I crazy?? And Sybs...careful with NFLX it's going to implode but maybe a few more quarters. Cramer said the other day that NFLX is becoming the new AMZN.

They're dumping their services and products at a loss just to bust competition and put people out of honest-paying jobs. This is a cruel practice and I cannot believe the Street is supporting this in the face of deteriorating fundamentals! AMZN will not be allowed to do this for long - if they don't have a huge (and I mean HUGE) trend change in their profits, AMZN will be cut in half overnight. This moment of reality will come sooner than later IMO. The longs better take a good look at the earnings, revenues, products and growth data and not be blinded by the scammer analysts who rather make money than tell the truth. Just note that there are alternatives to where your hard-earned money can be put to work - Companies with actual fundamentals, great cash flows, decent earnings and good returns on equity. AMZN is no where near a sound investment at these lofty valuations and with the latest earnings report, they confirmed this. I will be sending an article to Seeking Alpha soon to be published.

It persuaded the reflexive traders that AMZN was really great when in reality there was no alternative but to buy given the size of its position. In conjunction with a few quants, CapWorld (IMHO) painted the tape to encourage technical traders to load up. In the process, retail investors buying index tracking ETFs got to load up on this #$%$ at sky high valuations thanks to tacit collusion and rebalancing (and to sell AAPL at a discount...).. Wall Street is always innovating a way to capture dramatically more value than it creates. Most people don't realize how much of their retirement is taken in fees. ETFs have been cutting into them. WS used to be about things that created value -- real investing and investment banking (IPOs, M&amp;A, etc). These days, it is just a vehicle to churn paper assets (which creates no value in aggregate and is simply a tax). Once great investment banking firms are all run/dominated by trading... I am truly afraid that it is too late for the government to do anything about the mess the banksters have created. I was at a nano conference at a table of mostly Ph.D.s and MBAs (many from academia) and I was the only person that did not have a gun and had not been loading up on ammunition. No BS. It blew me away. The folks that are capturing all the value now (having essentially engaged in glorified theft via predatory trading with asymmetric information and infinite leverage unavailable to all but select financial institutions) will find that it only makes them targets and undermines their safety if/when things do break. The NYPD and the National Guard wouldn't be able to do a thing to protect the wealthy in NYC or CT if real unrest broke out... And the masters of the universe would learn Maslow's hierarchy of needs the hard way... It looks like the Fed is "all in" on a strategy doomed to fail badly and this time I doubt the public will be so docile. I hope I'm wrong. I really do.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1366943036244</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 22:23:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366943286316-669</Id><Topic><Title>Sell AMZN and buy AAPL and start sleeping at night</Title><Username>aapl_2000</Username><Timestamp>1366939049898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-25 21:17:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Agreed.

What happens to Amazon is more complex--eventually, it will be cut in half. What happens in next week depends on whether shareholders continue to be patient with meager earnings.
