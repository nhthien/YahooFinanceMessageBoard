But that is when the Fed started to expand printing and debase money and hasn't stopped since. And from their communiqes of that, they will not stop anytime soon. I don't think you will ever see those levels again in my view as they will destroy the currency before letting it happen again. But I guess you never say never. Fight the Fed here has proven to be just plain crazy, lately with very shallow dips since the $85 billion a month buying was put in place. And that's not ending so for my money, go with the flow or stay out of the way but to each his own. I think the valuations are rediculous in some cases but the Fed money keeps that possible until they stop doing it. Fighting that is just plain crazy right now.

Yes. The optionz market will fail to operate correctly in the crash and optionz contracts will not be honored. Derivativez were initially not going to be honored in the '08 crash until the fed and treas stepped in with talf &amp; tarp. The crash will happen this time BECAUSE of optionz and the etfs that use them - optionz are a buckey shop bet and have been amplified and stuffed into the system by the cboe to such an extent that you now have HOURLY binary optionz to trade..... The optionz market will be at the epicenter of the next financial collapse along with muni bond debt... Stox are toast az 'banks' will dump them in a nanosecond to 'preserve calital' . Sybil would not bet optionz.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1383251575754</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 16:32:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383251648970-144</Id><Topic><Title>singhlion2001 SINGLE MOMS are warning you, and shorts of great AMZN for long time</Title><Username>wforty</Username><Timestamp>1383246994903</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 15:16:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we have to understand, why AMZN is so strong?</Msg><Username>wforty</Username><Timestamp>1383251648970</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 16:34:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1383251678946-145</Id><Topic><Title>Ewe better cooooover, sheeple</Title><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1383245498282</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 14:51:38 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"just shorted 365's .sorry" Congrtulationz - sybil just joined you.</Msg><Username>sybil_rulez</Username><Timestamp>1383251678946</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-10-31 16:34:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1383251777027-146</Id><Title>Folks, the bandwaggon of shorts EMPTIED the fvck out this week.

The fed will say no more QE az they say "we have reached 'full employement' " , which will have been reached by attrition of unemployement bene's running out, and 50 somethingz throwing in the towel on ever finding a job again in their lifetimez. Bond interest rates, particularly the short and mid term will skyrocket az foriegn investorz say "no thanks at 1.5%, we need 7%"...

So, you realize that its overbought. You also then know that AMZN is the King of the Overbought. So, here is one tip that you can execute (and you have the wherewithal to do it ... I'm just the idea person): Daily, for a few days, buy continuous streams of AMZN-puts in large chunk. After that, start shorting the AMZN stock: 1st week by 1B, next week another 1B; then raise up the stake-- 2B worth of short for next two weeks (you can do it). WS will take notice. Looking at all those large block sells, they will start selling also. In 2-3 months, you can then cooly book 1B worth of profits easily, closing out all those positions! [And take this as my 1B worth of contribution and add it to your charitable foundation! That will give you and me immense satisfaction!
