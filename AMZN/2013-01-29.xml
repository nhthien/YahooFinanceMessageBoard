Amazon is virtually the only place where you can buy anything hassle free. I find myself going there for price checks and for items I think may not be in stock at stores or may be hard to find at stores. For example, I needed a door lock replacement part the other day. I could have spent an hour looking at home depot with no guarantee they would even have it. Plus there is huge value to the reviews you just don't get at stores. Add in the sales tax savings, and those reasons are why amazon is growing. I can imagine market cap going to $200m before a crash, so I'm shorting carefully. Its harder to short a stock when you find yourself giving them business, but its all about valuation in the long run.</Msg><Username>billy_berew</Username><Timestamp>1359445973257</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 02:52:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359446995462-4</Id><Title>growth limit</Title><Msg>if their model doesn't do food well, and doesn't do clothing well, how big can they really get?</Msg><Username>billy_berew</Username><Timestamp>1359446995462</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 03:09:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359448998894-5</Id><Topic><Title>growth limit</Title><Username>billy_berew</Username><Timestamp>1359446995462</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 03:09:55 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>At some point fairly soon, the street will price based on earnings.

Oh by the way techstrategy is doing pump and dump. On September 11, he bought 100 contracts of April 2013 calls @ 25 for Intel at about one dollar. Today's price? .56 -.58. Almost cut in half. He started shorting AMZN around $220 and you know where she it today. The probability of losing both bets in a set of two is 25 percent. Techstrategy nailed it! He accomplished only 1 out of 4 people can accomplish if they acted purely randomly! Re: Re: Re: Short the rips - dont cover the dips by techstrategy . Oct 5, 2012 5:31 PM . Permalink By the way, I have tripled that original INTC position yesterday. And, I have no intention of selling any of those contracts before 2Q 2013, I will hold the 2014 and 2015 contracts to maturity, unless INTC drops a lot, in which case I will sell to move deeper into the money. It's called investing Geeg. It's about recognizing assets that are being systematically mispriced and capitalizing upon it... Chump. Re: Re: Re: Re: Short the rips - dont cover the dips by geegenjar . Oct 5, 2012 8:52 PM . Permalink "By the way, I have tripled that original INTC position yesterday." So you bought 200 more contracts? What's the average cost for all 300 contracts now? By the way, if INTC goes up significantly, AMZN will go up even more. So you'll lose money on these two combined anyway. Re: Re: Re: Re: Re: Short the rips - dont cover the dips by techstrategy . Oct 5, 2012 10:35 PM .

Re: Re: Short the rips - dont cover the dips by techstrategy . Oct 6, 2012 10:51 AM . Permalink Not yet -- I'll explain in another month or so. You only understand options as a trading vehicle and not an investment vehicle -- mainly because you and most of the folks transacting options are mainly focused upon ST (weekly/monthly) options where theta decay is crushing and holding is flat out stupid. Good luck Geeg. ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- Thanks, professor.</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1359467051653</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 08:44:11 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359468660085-33</Id><Topic><Title>Techstrategy, I'm still waiting for your explanation.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1359467051653</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 08:44:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That assumes independence.

Amazon posted revenues of $21.27 billion, up 22% from a year ago, below the Street consensus at $22.26 billion, and about in the middle of the company’s guidance range of $20.25 billion to $2.75 billion. Profits were 21 cents a share, shy of the Street at 29 cents. Net income was $97 million, down 45%. Operating income in the quarter was $405 million, up 56% from a year ago; that was actually better than the guidance range of -$490 million to positive $310 million. Gross margin was 24.1%, well ahead of the Street consensus at 21.9%, according to the stock news site StreetAccount. Non-GAAP operating margin also beat expectations, at 3.2%, ahead of the Street at 2.2%. “We’re now seeing the transition we’ve been expecting,” CEO Jeff Bezos said in a statement. “After 5 years, eBooks is a multi-billion dollar category for us and growing fast – up approximately 70% last year. In contrast, our physical book sales experienced the lowest December growth rate in our 17 years as a book seller, up just 5%.

On a side note, I bought the February 285 call and sold the weekly 285 call against it for about $1 debit...if the stock closes this week at 285, my option will be worth around $8 or 9 bucks and the sold option will be worthless. Awesome risk reward.. I find that a calendar spread works very well using weekly options to play the announcements.

I agree and don't agree: I think it's more about market liquidity and during those period, it's always about the future growth: the reality is that AMZN has been earnings challenged for 17 years to capture sales. Whether that sales capture can be squeezed to the bottome through the juicer is not an issue , yet but tapping the bond market tells you that it needs money to operate with all the minimum earings. It's not a mom and pop stock, it's a trading stock and it's market cap is getting top 20 mainstreeam doing it. good luck and congrats if you have a piece of it and all the belief. Certainly the sales caputure at any price is being celbrated without question of any earnings model no doubt.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1359497014322</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:03:34 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359497018014-929</Id><Topic><Title>The #$%$ooo money changers took it down, then pumped it up, now they can bring it down again</Title><Username>obeseamerica</Username><Timestamp>1359496027636</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 16:47:07 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>first we need a punishment phase</Msg><Username>premiumlady</Username><Timestamp>1359497018014</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:03:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359497030201-930</Id><Title>it's still cheap need to get to forward p/e of 300</Title><Msg>will doble now 3000, so it will grow</Msg><Username>sfvip</Username><Timestamp>1359497030201</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:03:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359497032442-931</Id><Topic><Title>Happy I bought the $300 calls for $3.........3000 may be 20-30.we shall see.gl longs!</Title><Username>icu777</Username><Timestamp>1359496880521</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:01:20 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You are going to lose.

You cannot deposit your clicks in a bank, and buy groceries and other essential things with clicks.</Msg><Username>jimmype2</Username><Timestamp>1359497853668</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:17:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359497921712-990</Id><Title>What a joke they make 21 cents, shares jump 20 USD after close, equal to 20 years of profit !</Title><Msg>What a joke !!!!!</Msg><Username>david.rowe26</Username><Timestamp>1359497921712</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:18:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359497922056-991</Id><Topic><Title>What was the closing price today?</Title><Username>gaga_for_goog</Username><Timestamp>1359496840842</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:00:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>schwab has it at 268......I believe that was the close.</Msg><Username>actionspread</Username><Timestamp>1359497922056</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:18:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359497923863-992</Id><Title>should go higher....</Title><Msg>If the markets are up tomorrow, AMZN will probably pop another $10 from AHs levels.</Msg><Username>mystockisfalling</Username><Timestamp>1359497923863</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:18:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359497931899-993</Id><Topic><Title>A Typical Internet Stock</Title><Username>jimmype2</Username><Timestamp>1359497853668</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:17:33 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Isn't it great?

It's gone on with AMZn for year so guessing when it ends is fools game: but what we do know is the markte lost the leader AAPL of the whole bull market off of 2008 and now it's standing up in the earningless stocks.

If you were a major investor and you were going to dump shares tomorrow, it would behoove you to support and manipulate the price AH by always buy at the ask. Of course this works in reverse too. The real interpretation of results will occur tomorrow. What's frustrating is that the key two questions I was interested in (the kindle's stickiness for future sales, the effect on sales taxes specifically in the states effected) had been asked and both times the CFO purposely skimmed past the gist of the question.</Msg><Username>lived666or12</Username><Timestamp>1359498951576</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:35:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359499009503-1053</Id><Topic><Title>He can not fool all the people all the tiime</Title><Username>n59218</Username><Timestamp>1359498653622</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:30:53 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good for you.

But this hurts the local retail business, states who get no sales tax and so the economy.</Msg><Username>dj_jinspin</Username><Timestamp>1359499358452</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:42:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359499383773-1069</Id><Title>someone big must really want to LIQUIDATE.....seen this before...they jack it up</Title><Msg>to SELL to suckers like in 99. #$%$</Msg><Username>cwtripps</Username><Timestamp>1359499383773</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:43:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359499397224-1070</Id><Title>they trying to paint the tape</Title><Msg>on low volume, won't work up here</Msg><Username>sfvip</Username><Timestamp>1359499397224</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:43:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359499400173-1071</Id><Title>well looks like the market still loves AMZN!!!!!!!</Title><Msg>they will coontinue to grow..... continue to make more $..... and will burn shorts at every turn the crazy thing is when they start making reAL $$$$ AND THE GROWTH STOPS.....then it will fall tmagine that</Msg><Username>sandersbrock</Username><Timestamp>1359499400173</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:43:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359499410620-1072</Id><Topic><Title>Conf Call, Wow, these are Arrogant mutha fukkas!</Title><Username>thefattlady</Username><Timestamp>1359499311290</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:41:51 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Don't forget, slowing revenue growth, and dissapointing forcast, and missed earnings (and revenue) for the current quarter....

P/E of 200 for 20% revenuge growth???? Just not my style." You're calling Amazon arrogant but reading your post, you sound just as arrogant if NOT more! Who do you think you are to say what a stock price should be and then to even be so bold and arrogant to go against it! You really think the market cares about what you have to say? You really think they're gonna lower the price because you think it's over priced? I was once like you and was always on the wrong side of the market and lost tons of money all due to what I thought it should be and couldn't care less of what the market was doing because as long as I felt I was right who cares! Right? WRONG!!! If you want to make money in this market then don't get arrogant but respect what the market is telling you. For example, I didn't bother to think how undervalue AAPL was before earnings and looked at what the market was telling me about AAPL so I shorted right before the earnings. And today right before AMZN earnings guess what I did? That's right, I went long. GL "Markets are never wrong; opinions are," - Jesse L.

The earnings miss was due to equity in subsidiary and other expenses (unclear what other is or if they shifted things around). Very high tax rate over 50% probably due to realization of writedown on a deferred tax asset. That's the good news. The bad news: 1.Very bad revenue miss. This was probably due in part to bad Kindle Sales. Remember the Pacific Crest guy who brought forecasts down. This boosted profit in m opinion. When your gross margin is maybe -1% and operating margin on Kindle sales is like -11% and you come up maybe $60 million below expectations that boosts profit by $6.6 million and since Kindle sales were probably down as a percentage of total sales that might explain 20 basis points for so of gross margin. Keep in mind though, lower Kindle Sales mean lower e-book sales in future and less of the gross margin benefit in future years. Hence they top end of revnue guidance is below the consensus reflecting weaker Kindle and e-book sales and also a more generic weakness in revenues. Revenue problems was not driven by exchange rates. 2. If revenue growth slows down a lot of the benefits from negative operating working capital growth will slow down too in terms of FCF generation (from payables) 3. Diluted Share count up from 462 to 473. More dilution of investors. Also that means 11 million more shares at $280 per share (near recent prices) or $3.08 Billion more in valuation that must be justified. At $280m, we are talking $132.4 billion market cap at $280. 4. People are partying over gross margins, but guess what - not just a Kindle effect. As they get more service revenue gross margins go up but their fulfillment costs go up as well. Note that fulfillment went from 8.4% in Q42010 to 9.5% in Q42011 and now about 12.44% in Q4 2012. As gross margins rise, fulfillment costs rise too. 5. Firm's new trick is poor guidance. I model them getting just a bit above top of operating earnings range that is down from last year. 5. Weak sales might mean a sales tax hit. Guess what. That hit will occur eventually most of the rest of the country. Next 3 quarters mean tough comps after California tax hike. 6. No share repurchases lately. Amazon jumps in and buys when they think stock is undervalued. Last time was when prices were around 180 to 190 in fourth quarter last year and first quarter this year. No buying since suggesting Amazon thinks socik might be worth around $200 to $220 range. 7. Debt continues upward. Interest expense expanded again this quarter. Equity investments keep shedding value and probably will cause more income statement losses.

This is planned even before the ER is released. MM scares long investors by driving the price lower before the release then push the price up right after hour to create short squeeze. I don't think the short squeeze is over yet; We might see the price reached to $330 in a short time as long as the market continues the mad bull trend. AMZN is one of the highly manipulated stock(Besides NFLX) by MM in the market. Its movement cannot be justified rationally so just don't play against the trend and try to outsmart MM. You will get burnt easily. If you really hate Amazon, try to support your local store like Best Buy(although it also sucks in other way), at least local store give you first hand experience and provide employment in your area. We all know what will happen if Amazon squeeze every possible competitors out of the market.</Msg><Username>koolflyingdragon</Username><Timestamp>1359504074558</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:01:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>9</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359504097450-1265</Id><Title>vmw - down 21% today</Title><Msg>Amzn soppose to be a cload play, too</Msg><Username>sfvip</Username><Timestamp>1359504097450</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:01:37 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359504116748-1266</Id><Topic><Title>TROW making sure, calls are worth less..and PUTS r too</Title><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1359503795402</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:56:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>no need to play this for any reason.</Msg><Username>shares245</Username><Timestamp>1359504116748</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:01:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359504158277-1267</Id><Title>At no point in history have markets been so high and so hated at the same time</Title><Msg>markets a near all time highz, yet it iz being approached with general disdain az mutual fund managerz knowingly buy the top of a ponzi scheme using other peoplez money....</Msg><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1359504158277</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:02:38 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359504166490-1268</Id><Title>What's the chances this Pump Job opens lower tomorrow?</Title><Msg>Ridiculous AH'ers bullcrap.</Msg><Username>gambling2m</Username><Timestamp>1359504166490</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:02:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359504243046-1269</Id><Topic><Title>Wall street is the cess pool of Fraud!</Title><Username>gambling2m</Username><Timestamp>1359503223092</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 18:47:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Sounds like you bought puts today...

This is not level playing field when 5-10% tax on big ticket items becomes significant. This hurts local retailers as they cannot compete on price. They are forced to close shop and states lose tax revenue from them and states lose sales tax for everything Amazon sells. This tax revenue goes to spending on education and your police and fire department in your local state. Ever hear of stories like California going bankrupt?

I feel pretty sure about my analysis and hope it is able to spike above 300 this week.</Msg><Username>wallstreet.thief</Username><Timestamp>1359508330984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 20:12:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359508342740-1378</Id><Topic><Title>Mother of all short squueeeezes tomorrow</Title><Username>billinger2000</Username><Timestamp>1359507460412</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:57:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>And Thursday AM too...

All of your calls will be worthless unless you see a $20+ rise early.these sharp moves are unlikely... after a little pump in the AM your more likely to see a slow drag down movement until a month before next earnings. AMZN missed its earnings, and that might not show up right away but it will show up. if your a profitable day trader then i suggest you stick with it. options is a totally different game. i also suggest if you disregard that advise you start reading... a lot.

Sales- tax collection in a lot of states is just around the bend. No more cheating the government, they will have to start colleting as the now do in California and two other states. Revenue in those States are down by 10%. UhOh, not sure of the ‘makers" can keep it up for another year or two. Personally I thing it's nuts for a company that has a 3,000 plus P/E and trades at a price just pennies short of a 52 week high. No position, no long here and no short, just an observation. AMZN is just a company I follow, have owned for a few hours a time or two. Good luck to all longs, just be careful.</Msg><Username>rdhrolf</Username><Timestamp>1359510670071</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 20:51:10 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359510724113-1418</Id><Title>Big drop a few seconds before the close today, am I the only one noticed?</Title><Msg>It had been trading at 268.50 then went to 258 just seconds before the close, somebody, maybe a bank or trading firm.

Even WMT is better play.</Msg><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1359513009410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 21:30:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359513192803-1453</Id><Title>This is a great stock the more they miss and lower the expectations the higher she goes..</Title><Msg>It missed the mark and WS bids it higher and higher....What a company don't you just love this hot air?

This is not uncommon for the closing price to change within a few seconds of close when the volume is so high all at once. Everyone was trying to position trades based on derivative positions right at close. In this case it was most likely call positions where traders took on a short position for protection, that later covered in AH, thus pushing the stock up significantly in AH.

Every anal-yeast as a human, has to look within himself and should invoke his conscience, to see what they are pumping for their own paycheck and greed is really right or not ultimately... so many small-fry-Joes are lulled-in into such traps insanely and then they flush them out! After all, 70-80-90 years etc. is not a long time... they'll have to answer to a Higher-Up soon, isn't it?</Msg><Username>kathlenebradshaw</Username><Timestamp>1359519832566</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 23:23:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359519931930-1517</Id><Title>ALL THESE SCAM BULLIES WILL BE SILENCED TOMORROW BY FRAUD STREET BANSKTER TERRROSITS ANY WAY:LOL</Title><Msg>Bears don't have to do any thing............just deploy leap puts on fraud pump for dump hell in scamazon trading pit</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1359519931930</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 23:25:31 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359519932143-1518</Id><Topic><Title>Ben B could make this drop like a rock tomorrow</Title><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1359507384289</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:56:24 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>agreed once if not the fed in the afternoon tomorrow then nonfarm payrolls on friday. but amazon up 9% tomorrow mornin done deal now.</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1359519932143</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 23:25:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359519932905-1519</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow, all call buyers, and put buyers will be crying..Just watch it 270</Title><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1359513262989</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 21:34:22 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>they are scamming every one.</Msg><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1359519932905</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 23:25:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359520044648-1520</Id><Title>TOMORROW FRAUD STREET WILL KILL BOTH CALL/PUT BUYERS IN WEEKLY SCAM TRADING PIT</Title><Msg>AND THE CRIMINALS WILL CRASH THIS FRAUD AAPLE STYLE LOL HANG EM HIGH GROW BALLS 99% ZOMBIE CLOWNS IN USA</Msg><Username>kensandhu</Username><Timestamp>1359520044648</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 23:27:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359520137455-1521</Id><Title>It's test time...

Just think about it this way --- If there was a stock market 3,000 years ago and Amazon was traded on that exchange, then a person that invested $ 1.00 in Amazon would just now be getting his original $ 1.00 investment back. Not one single dime of profit, just his/her original investment. That investment would have been originally made approximately 1,500 years before Christ was even born! That my friend, is an analogy about a stock with a 3,000 P/E multiple that you should never forget. With that in mind, which direction do you really think the stock is most likely to head?</Msg><Username>mardob55</Username><Timestamp>1359521963704</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 23:59:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message></Date>
