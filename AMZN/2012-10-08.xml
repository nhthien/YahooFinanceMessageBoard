It's not known how many of those have contributed to the subprime housing mortgage meltdown, but it has affected every state, including Arizona.

As a result, illegal immigrants were able to obtain home mortgages which they could not afford.

I don't play for the short term. I look at the competitive dynamics and the LT potential to extract value from the business system. On the fundamentals, Amazon's position is degrading every day. The Nook case study highlights that. Target, WalMart and others will all align with Nook, which will get active in store promotional support across the country. Amazon will have to rely on expensive direct to consumer advertising... The cloud plays are JUST STARTING to get competitive. I like IBM, ORCL and GOOG's chances to limit the upside for AMZN.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1349711106749</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 11:45:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349711255846-44</Id><Topic><Title>HEY CHALK?

They had a solid performance that year, growing revenue, earnings and cash flow in the face of a deep recession and one of the worst years for corporate profits. Most analysts and pundits seem to think Amazon is immune to changes in macro economic environment largely on the basis of the 2009 results. But I wonder if that disconnect would repeat itself in the next recession. The e-tail landscape has changed dramatically since then and they do operate primarily in the consumer-discretionary market. Still the stock behaves like there is no connection between Amazon business and the economy as a whole. The relative strength on day like today continuously amazes me.</Msg><Username>philtmcnasty8</Username><Timestamp>1349720199822</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:16:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1349720242105-116</Id><Title>techstrategu? is the "new normal" now to sell AAPL daily/ and buy AMZN?</Title><Msg>then we know the players don't care about today's earnings at all right?

Stox are very high AND very hated right now... In 1999, stox were high - but everybody loved them, even the barber had a stok pick in 1999..... In 1975 stoks were hated, but they were very low priced, the valuation of the s&amp;p in 1974 traded at a LOW 6x earnings... So in that recession stox were low but hated; and in the era of irrational exhuberance stox were high but loved..... Fast forward to 2012.... Stox are high and trading at INSANE valuations (320 x earmings for this pig... That means you would have to collect amzn stok earnings for 320 years before you could accumulate enough earnings to cover the cost of 1 share of amzn stok) AND stoks are hated - sybil didnt exist in 1999 because there were no bears... Now there are bears everywhere that think stoks are worthless scamz, that hate wall street and are pulling their money out of the markets to bury in the back yard... Stox high + stox hated == unsustainable markets filled with instability....</Msg><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1349745312752</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:15:12 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349745744528-181</Id><Topic><Title>Will be a bad quarter</Title><Username>buford_puser</Username><Timestamp>1349554093629</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 16:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't have a quote. It's common sense. A lot of people buy from Amazon solely to avoid sales tax on big purchases. In that sense, the 20% is extremely conservative. The big puchases are the ones affected by the sales tax, so if only 5% of purchase transactions don't happen because of sales tax, that could easily be 20% of total revenue, and most likely is 30% or more.</Msg><Username>buford_puser</Username><Timestamp>1349745744528</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:22:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349747183366-182</Id><Topic><Title>At no point in history have stox been so high and so hated at the same time</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1349745312752</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:15:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>to make one wanna own hated stocks: it's certainly helping to chase stocks to the upside by hedge funds with the printing support. I don't know if alleviates the "hating" of stocks but is certainly "blowing out" the valuations of them. Leave it to the Fed to create the 3rd "wealth effect" paper bubble in 12 years on the back of them running the printin press. With each one, the participation becomes more narrow: certainly has helped Bezos' wealth. Bernanke seems more interested in helping the ultra richv via another paper bubble than helping the economy have a sustainable recovery. It's not real captial formation, it's paper "wealth effect" engineering to the few and priviledged.</Msg><Username>mets41us</Username><Timestamp>1349747183366</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 21:46:23 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349752029179-183</Id><Topic><Title>Will be a bad quarter</Title><Username>buford_puser</Username><Timestamp>1349554093629</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-06 16:08:13 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The quarter will show you are wrong in terms of near term impact. It only affects purchases in those states where tax is being collected and the impact will largely be felt in the holiday quarter when most big ticket items are purchased. Plus, the real reason Amazon chose to launch Kindle AFTER the back to school window and too early to be "novel" for the holiday season was to hide the impact of sales tax collection. Anyone who has listened to the past few conference calls knows the analysts are doing everything humanly possible NOT to dig deeper. If any of them ask about the daily sales in California ex-product launches (e.g. Kindle) before and after tax collection, I will be VERY surprised... What you are correct about is the selection bias that collecting tax will have on Amazon over time, especially as competitors are clearly seeking to amplify said selection bias. Best Buy already said it will match online pricing on big ticket items (and have the store to kick the tires and Geek Squad to install), BN Nook is getting promotion at Target and WalMart (the big boys are helping Amazon's most established digital books competitor). If so, the economics of Prime will deteriorate rapidly...</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1349752029179</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 23:07:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1349753162494-184</Id><Topic><Title>techstrategy's INTC position . . . so far . . .</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1349720938921</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-08 14:28:58 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess the question is whether INTC will stop falling at 18-19 and if it does how much it can bounce.

I really want one of my other investments to mature first so that I can get WAY more aggressive here. We all know this is a scam, but no one has systematically taken on the future growth #$%$ (and looked the distribution of outcomes in different "macro" scenarios). I will. There is an insane amount of fuzzy thinking in this cult... Trust me on this as well. You want to have a few long positions that are highly levered to the systemic changes that will occur as we establish a new equilibrium...
