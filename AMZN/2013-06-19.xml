Factors that caused defaults included fluctuating regional land values, commodity booms and busts, cost overruns and financial mismanagement, unrealistic projections of the future, and private-purpose borrowing. The report also said that since World War II, revenue bonds have been a new source of default, largely a result of revenue overprojections. The most infamous default cases involving general obligation bonds include New York City's default in 1975 and Cleveland in 1978. The largest default in the history of the municipal bond market was the Washington Public Power Supply System's (WPPSS) default on $2.25 billion in bonds. WPPSS launched a risky program to build five nuclear power plants in the 1970s to supply electricity to the Pacific Northwest. Only one of the five planned nuclear plants was ever completed. The WPPSS fiasco gave a lot more credibility to concerns that tax-exempt bonds were not a completely safe bet.

Seriously though, AMZN is going to 200, it may hit 300 yes, but your downside risk here is huge. The stock has very little momentum to push higher, the companies cashflow is horrible, the company still has no earning. I can say with much certainty that you are buying at or near the top. This stock could even push back down to 100/share if Ben decides to Taper.
