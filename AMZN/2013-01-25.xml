But I think it is not sustained into 2nd half, fear of fed withdrawal too high and new money rotation signaling top is near IMO. That said, none of the basic materials suggest that this is a sustained global recovery move in the indexes, CAT is struggling at 95 range and steel and aluminum are nearer lows due to many reasons including skewed supply and demand issues thanks to China and Wall Street finance deals. They keep pointing to transports as all time highs as evidence as sustained rally, that is the one metric that all seem to be following and I think it is a false indicator right now.

Now that AAPL has been eliminated from from that type of stock, AMZN has attraced those types here. Meanwhile, the market imploded "mom and pops" stock , most owned to a round trip. So the market's strength is even more dominated by hedge fund chasing. I'm no sure mom and popl want to own the ones earnings challenged even if the Street sells the story of the ones "spending" as strong. So far so good for them. Mom and Pop can't be happy with AAPL near 52 week lows. I was wrong to think it would survive past the ones with all spending. That didn't happen in this agig bull market. The "General" shot last was not AAPL, surprised with it's backing of money and dividend cushion but the market is the market.

Just like the last periods of housing and tech in2000, you get the same type of moves, except now it's on "unlimited" mode to now. Thats your justification, it's a trading stock and being used for bullish strategies, not bearish ones. Just slap a story on it perpetually: "now that AAPL has plateaued, the content makers of the future are in vogue." AMZN is the "Swiss Army Knife" of all it. Is it incredibly dangerous to see this when AAPL, the pllar of the up market since 2008, is no pretty much now not , and replaced by loss leaders without proving earnings while raes back up against leveraged Fed,, you'd think so at some point.

My friends and I bought cameras from B&amp;H instead of Amazon due to the tax reason. So, in the last quarter the sales tax will have big impact to a lot of people. Either Amazon has to cut the price lower enough to attract them to buy or people will purchase somewhere else in order to avoid sales tax. Tax in CA and NY is about 9%. The expensive items will have big impact.

How could you be in the face of this run-up? I think shorts are very confident that amzn is over-valued (grossly over-valued in my view). It's a matter of timing. My timing has been terrible. Now the earnings report could be a catalyst for a sharp downward move. We will see. I had every intention of buying a boat load of puts going into the earnings call. Now I'm confused, and not sure at all. One note... I don't see how longs could be so confident that the trend will continue.

But with the level of sales they are achieving (and growing each quarter) any change in operations that could alter the margins just a couple percent could result in hundreds of millions in profits and could amount to dollars in earnings rather than pennies. That could change the pe from 3900 to 100 in just a qtr or two. With this stock growing sales the time to go short will be when you see the sales growth slowing down.

Problem with retail is that they can continue to sell increasing amounts and not make money. Only hurts their competitiion. Zero sum game. When they try to improve margins people will shop elsewhere. The tablet market is such that they make nothing on those sales. And that market is saturated. The cloud business is profitable but they don't really have a huge business there in relation to their total sales. Not big enough to move the needle. This is a hard stock.

Bricks and mortar retailers are getting an online presence and being more competitive on price. Getting quicker delivery. Amazon is now collecting sales tax and building many distribution centers. Seem to be getting much closer in their operations vs. their competitors except for some of the other things they are into (Kindle, AWS etc), which in my opinion get to be distractions and gives them too many more competitors in different industries to deal with. My point is at what point does the company get valued more closely to their competitors. WMT had a similar run and then sat for decades to grow into their valuation. Is that going to happen here. WMT at 470B sales around 230B market cap. Price to sales around .5. AMZN current year sales 80B at .5 gives cap of 40B. With cap of 130B three times over priced.

True FCF has not increased materially. Most of the growth in cash has been from increased revenues on the negative working capital model, but that is not true FCF (as that cash has claims on it). Should the revenue ever fail to grow as rapidly, that FCF would decline rapidly. Once the stock price stops going parabolic, compensation structure will have to skew toward cash to retain talent and will serve as a drag. Vicious circle... But wait, there's more... Google Shopping is an inherently superior model that better aligns with existing retail incentives. It needs deeper transaction integration, but will get it.
