Which part of the company will you be getting back? An office chair? How about a paper clip? None of the above. Also, will you ever be able to cast votes DIRECTLY to any of the AMZN ballots? No you can only qualify to cast a proxy vote. If you want to split hair on "share" and "ownership", you can, but I won't be entertaining. In my point of view, your existence as a share holder is to provide financial leverage to the company. No more, no less. You are lucky if the board of directors vote 'YES' to give you dividends as a token of thanks to their successes or failures.</Msg><Username>hb5fa_2</Username><Timestamp>1367499666094</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:01:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367500039631-16</Id><Title>254 will be tested early today.</Title><Msg>Of course, there will be some "resistance" there.

Oh boy, I like that phrase. You should be a stock broker.-promoter. Let's see now...first, who invented this catchy phrase "secular bear market?" And who invented the definition of a "secular bear market?" And what makes it "secular" as opposed to say "non-secular?" And once you get through explaining that one, how about this one: What defines a "bear" "market?" Is it defined as the DOW trading at near all time highs? If so, then I guess we are in that "bear market" of yours. Truth is, it's all word games, invented lingo by those making a career out of selling stocks or brokering sales of stocks to the public. No such thing. Just arbitrary pumping and/or dumping, all day, every day, where no one but the pumpers/dumpers themsleves know what they plan to do next. So, today's so-called "bear" can turn turn into tomorrow's "bull" or vice versa, thus rendering any attempt to label the game as being a "Bull" or "Bear" useless. Once again, you are attempting to portray yourself as one who knows the mindset of what the big money people who control the bid-ask are planning to do in the future, based upon what they did in the past (i.e. you think that by looking at a chart, or "RSI" or whatever past-tense concept you choose, that you can sort of predict what is going to happen henceforth. But elsewhere you claim that you are not a "short term" (however you define short term...) trader. Comment: Please make up your mind. Either you are a short term trader or not.</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1367501045622</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:24:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367501095957-19</Id><Topic><Title>254 will be tested early today.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1367500039631</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:07:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Of course you probably don't own the common because you know what's ultimately in store here.

I think you should ask yourself that question, because if it's about you trying to prove yourself as a guru, then you should ask yourself why it is important to you that you should care one wit about impressing a bunch of total strangers on a message board. These are folks who you will probably never meet in person, and, thus, even from the silly angle that "showing off my prowess makes me feel good," you will never get the opportunity in the real world. In any case, if you are not a day trader (however one defines that concept), then what gives with all of your "the chart says," and "RSI," and "support level" talk? That is the talk of someone who WANTS some short term movement to go his way. Otherwise, why mention it at all?

Look at the AAPL and AMZN. Did anyone switch this yesterday ? Keep in mind the following tips when playing the stocks. * Don't fight against trend. AMZN is on down trend, AAPL is on up trend from TA perspective. * Don't be fall in love the stock that you have. * Don't hate the stock which is the company that you don't like. I don't like iPhones/iPads, but I like the AAPL stock now.</Msg><Username>ling.chen</Username><Timestamp>1367503758284</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:09:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367503811833-36</Id><Title>A lift-off!</Title><Msg>Hooah, hooah, hooah!!!!!</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1367503811833</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:10:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367503888163-37</Id><Title>INTC's and AAPL's money will be shoved into AMZN.</Title><Msg>Whoa!</Msg><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1367503888163</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:11:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367504007029-38</Id><Topic><Title>A lift-off!</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1367503811833</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 10:10:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yes, with an upgrade the stock is struggling to stay green.

If you read the past posts of Sybil, you would notice that she claims that she's not a market timer and will wait "forever" for AMZN to tank when AMZN seems strong or not weak enough to fall any time soon. When AMZN appears weak, poised to plunge or erode further, she claims that she can read charts and see that AMZN is due to drop further "soon." Enough said about this woman.

That's a kind of fraudulent activity, though legal." Well, not necessarily. Perhaps when you bought it your thinking was that it is undervalued. And you hope to sell it to someone else who likewise thinks it is undervalued even at the new, higher price. Or even if the new buyer believes he is paying fair value. Short selling, however, means that the shorter believes it is OVERVALUED. The fact that the buyer of such shorted shares believes otherwise is no the point. The point is that from the SHORT SELLERS PERSPECTIVE, he believes that he is legally defrauding the buyer by selling him what he believes to be overvalued shares..</Msg><Username>samueldavid1234</Username><Timestamp>1367511811843</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 12:23:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367511975292-84</Id><Topic><Title>Shorts, when will you realize that you've been conned again?</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1367501042144</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-02 09:24:02 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>gee, How about giving us all of your price target levels and what they mean to you again?

You can paint it anyway you want bruce your understanding of Amazon's financials is when you buy low and you should sell high and it's all about revenue growth. I admit that makes sense until growth slows and metrics are eroding badly. Did you sell on the night of earnings or are you still holding or did you not even have a position the day of earnings when you were pretty much saying the same thing.

The target is only 150k. Don't be surprised if it beats. This stuff is often lumpy and last month was terrible. If it comes in on target or above at the market keeps going up. LNKD getting beat up after hours. That's what happens when a stock is priced for perfection. AMZN has done well over time, not taking poundings probably as bad as they should have. My overall question with the markets is do they just keep going up regardless of below target revenues? Seems to me we are just adding lots of air and then hoping that miraculously everything just works out in the end. I'm net long but a PUT buyer and or short in what I consider high priced stocks that are not fundamentally doing very well.
