Other 80% from $ printing. But that doesn't stop the natives from re-electing those same crooks. Only way to fight back is to move your wealth outside the US, out of the dollars, and hope that responsible countries like New Zealand and Canada remain honest. Raising taxes on the rich doesn't even close the huge gap. You cannot get re-elected without promising the natives freebies. This is why spending will always be out of control. The great enabler to this scam is the Federal Reserve. Stop $ printing and there will be a balanced budget.</Msg><Username>nje457</Username><Timestamp>1354728380629</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:26:20 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354728492947-93</Id><Title>GGGGoing all the way up without correction?</Title><Msg>No pullbacks?

Just look at the rocket from 218 to 254 : alot thought the collapse was upon them at 218. Now it has to collapse even greater than the rocket up just to get even.

He said if they really started fighting over shares and some weight became available to not make it easy for anybody else to grab a good amount of shares. The other rumor is Bezos broker is buying for his personal account all he can in small amounts as long as AMZN stays under 320, they are betting above that by Feb 1st. Somebody bought 500 contracts of the Jan 320 which is way out of the money but that trader expects AMZN to be close to that by Jan 19th, earnings are Jan 31st! Based on all this, the 300 305 310 315 320 325 330 are bargains that have not moved up at all but soon will a great deal. AMZN breaking its 52 week high very soon is not a rumor lol,more like a lock, we will see a pile in on margin soon if you ask me, as only 2% short could not stop its momentum even for a dollar or two when they try as hard as they can.</Msg><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1354732295093</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 13:31:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354732319780-132</Id><Title>Going to guess it's around 252 possibly by tomorrow,</Title><Msg>running low on fuel</Msg><Username>riskreversal777</Username><Timestamp>1354732319780</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 13:31:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354732452893-133</Id><Topic><Title>You will need to Download the anonymous Tor Browser to read the latest AMZN rumors on the stock boards</Title><Username>namfong43</Username><Timestamp>1354732295093</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 13:31:35 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'll watch as Tor Network takes that position.

JB just sold 5% of his AMZN, for 100 million. I'd say he's doing something right. I trust JB more than techstrategy. If the model is flawed, JB will figure it out, and correct it. Here's what we do know about Amazon's model: They have the highest customer satisfaction and loyalty ever measured. They've grown at a ridiculous rate, and haven't had any major growing pains. The only "flaw" is that they are willing to sacrafice immediate profit for long term growth. I've read that the reason Amazon dominates is because no one will try to compete with them since Amazon has such low margins.
