Just look at AMZN, it's netted over 17 years about $1.9 billion in earnings while Bezos has cashed in trading his stock paper for dollars many times that number. As long as the stock stays in nosebleed levels, it's not problem. However, when the stock goes on reality, then the paper game is realized to what it was: a paper finanical engineering game where insiders and hedge funds come first, investors second. We live in a leveraged hedge fund, paper engineered, economy dominated and catered to the wishes of WS, hedge funds, and CEO's with huge options. The normal worker has never made less as % of what these top guys make. Just look at the comments of a guy like Larry Fink: who may be the biggest criminal around extolling the virtures of QE b/c it helps his funds gamble while putting the costs on the public in higher everyday stuff and food etc. This is a guy who is said to talk to Tim Geithner weekly since 2008. So the decisions are made for and by these guys. Now we're to the point where we have bubbles again, with a #$%$ dollar to thank for it, while Bernake's balance sheet is a leveraged hedge fund balloon. . They havn't created any wealth for the Country , just transferred it to themselves the last few years and leveraged up the paper game like a fat kid bloated with pounds of Reece's Peanut Butter Cups in his stomach. He's gonna end up puking that stuff up. And so we will with all this trash paper eaten by the Fed Reserve.</Msg><Username>im_too_hipp</Username><Timestamp>1354626373368</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 08:06:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354626560060-15</Id><Title>Amzn is like the housing bubble and the internet bubble</Title><Msg>Hey Cramer, are you using eyepops to value this company?

Helps the stock get to 200+ ?shr while earning pennies. It's also why Bezos doesn't split the shares anymore as it would hurt the low float game. Not sure the game is over, but Bezos hasn't sold shares in along time. To me it's not about AMZN not being a viable compnay, it's just that it's been used as a trading stock for so long that it's now over 200/shr while earing pennies. So the low float game is somewhat exteneded I would say compared to comparable stock values in the market. And that doesn't even touch on the reality that thier compettion in all directions have huge built cash hoareds so earnings will stay challenged. You know what they say about looking a "gifit horse" in the mouth.</Msg><Username>im_too_hipp</Username><Timestamp>1354629880082</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 09:04:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354629919316-23</Id><Topic><Title>Now its trading below 250 AH...

That's what happens on the opposite side of things like this and why I keep saying that the capital markets themselves, not Benny B are the cause of the massive malinvestment. By allowing TRADERS rather than investors to dominate capital market signals, institutional longs killed productive investment in this country. They want to blame the Fed. It is #$%$. The Fed has simply amplified the signal which has made the scam more visible... The HFT is the REAL tax in the system, but its collateral damage is far greater.

The US Gov't may not see it for what it really is, but Apple, Google, WalMart and Target do. And, the US gov't has opened the door for Apple and Google (who have enough cash to survive for years without 1 penny in revenue) to go directly after Amazon lifeline. All the pumpers cheered the ruling against Apple on content pricing by DOJ. The reality is that it was bad competitive strategy on Apple's part anyway. It makes its money on the hardware. It now can sell the content as a loss leader and Amazon's entire content profitability model is hosed. And, Apple can open up its device network to self-publishing at lower rates than Amazon. Of course, all of this also applies to Google, except that Google will also be stepping up the war on AWS.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354668718593</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 19:51:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354668897225-210</Id><Topic><Title>Panic covering and margin callz from the ladt runnup are winding down</Title><Username>philandjoel1e</Username><Timestamp>1354656433269</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 16:27:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Congrats Huck.</Msg><Username>techstrategy</Username><Timestamp>1354668897225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 19:54:57 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354669312332-211</Id><Title>Will be 238 or lower by December 21st 2012</Title><Msg>Just so you know, I bought puts today and yesterday that expire in Dec, the $255 puts easy money for me Thanks bagholders, lol</Msg><Username>bagholderslose</Username><Timestamp>1354669312332</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 20:01:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354669681287-212</Id><Topic><Title>SYBIL IS THE YAHOO MESSAGE BOARD CLOWN</Title><Username>philandjoelle</Username><Timestamp>1354650463055</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-12-04 14:47:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ROFLMAO!!!
