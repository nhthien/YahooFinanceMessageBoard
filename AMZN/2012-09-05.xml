But what if Wal-Mart goes right at them? Wal-Mart has superior logistics, stores for product pick-up, warehousing and a topnotch fleet. How can Amazon w/home delivery compete in store-based? My guess: Amazon captures party favors and janitorial supplies and a zillion small items but not high margin big products. You will pick-up your internet-purchased flatscreen at Wally World.
