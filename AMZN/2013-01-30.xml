I have to wonder. After all, the numbers are right here. Let's just cut the #$%$ and get to the facts. Free cash flow decreased to $395 million -- on sales of $.27 billion, or 0.065%. That sucks. It's also down 81% from last year when it was $2.09 billion on $48.08 billion (4.35%, which is still pretty #$%$.) Net income was down 45% as well. And while full year sales were up 27%, net was down on the higher sales amount, and so was operating income on a full year basis! In fact it was down 22%! Transition says Bezos? Like hell. Further, net sales are forecast under estimates for the next quarter and the company's operating income range is wider on the negative (loss) side than positive. Everyone wants to talk about the increased cash position. Did you notice where it came from? The company sold just over $3 billion in debt -- but the cash position increased by about half that. Worse, depreciation and amortization roughly doubled! Doubled folks, while sales were up 27%. That's not good, it's bad! Your depreciation and amortization should not be rising faster than sales; if it is you're becoming less efficient, not more. It's good that payables were lower at year end and receivables were inline -- that's positive and means your control of both vendors and customer credit is reasonable. Fulfillment expenses were up 36% in the last three months -- and up 47% on the year -- while sales were up 27%. Remember that some sales are digital in format and have near-zero fulfillment expense. This is not good either; fulfillment expenses increasing faster than sales is again an indication of efficiency problems. In this case that increase is not small either, especially on a full-year basis. Fulfillment expenses rising at nearly double the rate of sales increase is especially troubling! G&amp;A is rising faster too -- 36% on the year. And while interest expense is relatively modest at $92 million, it now is more than double interest income, where last year it was near-parity. That, of course, came from selling that $3 billion (roughly) in new debt, and will continue to be there in the future. And by the way, without that interest expense the company would have made a profit on the year. A small profit... but a profit. Oh, and if that's not enough, growth is slowing. A lot. By 38% in the last quarter of the year (compared to 2011) and by 30% on the full year. Forward stock price multiple expansion is supposed to come from increasing sales growth on a percentage basis, not contracting. Of particular concern is the fact that electronics and general merchandise sales growth rates for the last three months -- Christmas Season -- dropped approximately in half from last year. While media increased a bunch it's also only about a third of the size of general merchandise. "Other" is inconsequential; about 7% of the whole. This chart from the release says it all: The market is ramping this firm's stock price into a deteriorating growth story. IMHO you're nuts.

The plafform of hype story supercedes the reality of the numbers to greater and greater heights. I'd expect a phone coming and this new advertizing marketplace intro ahead to give AMZN all kind of new hype ahead and that's what they constantly want. If you notice, they market is not judging on waiting for AMZN to make profits as they take it higher and higher and now the sales are slowing: which is why they will keep coming with intro's to combat that.

The firm notes gross profit dollar growth of 42.5% (vs. 38% estimated) and 37% in the prior year. On this, the analyst comments, "we find the favorable mix shift towards higher gross margin businesses (e.g., 3P and Other/AWS) to be well underway." On the revenue, the firm notes revenues increased 22% y/y, 600 bps below the 28% we had been anticipating. Given this, Sena is reducing 2013 revenue estimate 6% to $75 billion. They are also lowering long-term revenue growth estimate by 500bps on average to the low 20s y/y vs. high 20s previously. "We reiterate that this revenue reduction is estimated to come from Amazon's lower gross margin 1P retail revenues, thereby minimizing the impact to gross profitability," the analystcomments. Sena notes gross margin improvement to outweigh revenue deceleration. "To arrive at this conclusion, we breakdown the gross profit contribution historically among 1P retail revenues (booked gross of COGS), 3P retail revenues (booked net), and Other/AWS revenues where expenses also fall below the gross profit line. What we found is that faster steady growth from 3P unit sales and Other/AWS is likely to driver higher blended gross margins (i.e., 30%+ in three years), even assuming no future gross margin expansion within Amazon's 1P retail business. Therefore, even on lower 1Q13 and 2013 estimates and lower revenue estimates over the near and long-term, we are modeling higher overall gross profit dollar growth."</Msg><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1359549972485</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:46:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359550015424-146</Id><Topic><Title>This company would not exist without wallstreet mafia</Title><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359536145891</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 03:55:45 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh yeah, more upgrades from wallstreet mafia bankster.</Msg><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359550015424</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:46:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359550133455-147</Id><Topic><Title>Europe's upcoming tax regulation will cost Amazon $2 bln</Title><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359545771847</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 06:36:11 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>We European will force them to pay taxes like all the other brave citizens!</Msg><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359550133455</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:48:53 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359550153712-148</Id><Topic><Title>2 VERY IMPORTANT MUST READ MESSAGES FOR SHORTS</Title><Username>takeoverfreak</Username><Timestamp>1359549424994</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:37:04 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>sux to be short....gonna be some pain felt 4 sure</Msg><Username>haroldinaustin</Username><Timestamp>1359550153712</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 07:49:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359550175515-149</Id><Topic><Title>Margin expansion? 1.8%?

After all, the numbers are right here. Let's just cut the #$%$ and get to the facts. Free cash flow decreased to $395 million -- on sales of $.27 billion, or 0.065%. That sucks. It's also down 81% from last year when it was $2.09 billion on $48.08 billion (4.35%, which is still pretty #$%$.) Net income was down 45% as well. And while full year sales were up 27%, net was down on the higher sales amount, and so was operating income on a full year basis! In fact it was down 22%! Transition says Bezos? Like hell. Further, net sales are forecast under estimates for the next quarter and the company's operating income range is wider on the negative (loss) side than positive. Everyone wants to talk about the increased cash position. Did you notice where it came from? The company sold just over $3 billion in debt -- but the cash position increased by about half that. Worse, depreciation and amortization roughly doubled! Doubled folks, while sales were up 27%. That's not good, it's bad! Your depreciation and amortization should not be rising faster than sales; if it is you're becoming less efficient, not more. It's good that payables were lower at year end and receivables were inline -- that's positive and means your control of both vendors and customer credit is reasonable. Fulfillment expenses were up 36% in the last three months -- and up 47% on the year -- while sales were up 27%. Remember that some sales are digital in format and have near-zero fulfillment expense. This is not good either; fulfillment expenses increasing faster than sales is again an indication of efficiency problems. In this case that increase is not small either, especially on a full-year basis. Fulfillment expenses rising at nearly double the rate of sales increase is especially troubling! G&amp;A is rising faster too -- 36% on the year. And while interest expense is relatively modest at $92 million, it now is more than double interest income, where last year it was near-parity. That, of course, came from selling that $3 billion (roughly) in new debt, and will continue to be there in the future. And by the way, without that interest expense the company would have made a profit on the year. A small profit... but a profit. Oh, and if that's not enough, growth is slowing. A lot. By 38% in the last quarter of the year (compared to 2011) and by 30% on the full year. Forward stock price multiple expansion is supposed to come from increasing sales growth on a percentage basis, not contracting. Of particular concern is the fact that electronics and general merchandise sales growth rates for the last three months -- Christmas Season -- dropped approximately in half from last year. While media increased a bunch it's also only about a third of the size of general merchandise. "Other" is inconsequential; about 7% of the whole. This chart from the release says it all: The market is ramping this firm's stock price into a deteriorating growth story.</Msg><Username>singhlion2001</Username><Timestamp>1359552247941</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:24:07 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359552486707-190</Id><Title>Amazon - the bear killer</Title><Msg>For the shorts who are too lazy to read, I'll summarize: 1) Jeff Bezos is the best living CEO of his generation. 2) P/E and Cash on Hand Are Overrated, Amazon is spending billions on where their business is going as opposed to what it is today. 3) Amazon is the Roman Empire of eTail, Amazon is now killing former competitors without even trying. 4) Too Many Angry Shorts...

Operating profit exceeded high end of range. The losses came from other expenses (maybe currency related), increases in the tax rate that look look unusual one time items and a seemingly higher than usual loss on investments in busineses accounted for under the equity method. That said, revenue was very soft and guidance was bad for profit and revenue. The "bull" story is operating margins better than thought so progress being made on margins. This is probably partially due to lower Kindle sales and shift from books to e-books.</Msg><Username>miggyryn</Username><Timestamp>1359552906968</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:35:06 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359553006264-194</Id><Title>Will write med atm calls..... $183 lol... ice is now really thin...</Title><Msg>and added to my short last night +$186... and would keep shorting as long as it take....</Msg><Username>optionstrader008</Username><Timestamp>1359553006264</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:36:46 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359553087048-195</Id><Topic><Title>Help me understand.

They don't subtract that against FCF even though it is akin to paying workers in cash and having them buy the stock from you the next day. AMZN does not count capital leases as capital expenditures even though it raises PPE and is equivalent to issuing debt for long term use of building. These two items alon reduce their FCF by $1.6 to $1.7 billion. In other words no FCF. Momo boys may have their way. I can get a $282 valuation with momo boy assumptions. Long run 5% margins, growth of 24%, 21%, 20, 18% and then slowly tapering down to 4% steady state 15 years from today. I only use a 9.1% discount rate for what is a very risky stock. I don't even adjust for FCF being back end loaded which means the PV is overstated (Q1 will have negative FCF and Q4 very positive). Time value of money it matters. In other words everything goes off without a hitch. So, as Doug Kass says never short on valuation (alone). If that were the case I would be running to short Netflix. Ride, ride, ride, let it ride. I suspect analysts will forecast EPS and revenues above likely outcome. Wait till around 4 days before next earnigns and if it is sitting over $300 go for it.</Msg><Username>miggyryn</Username><Timestamp>1359553541224</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:45:41 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359553620429-207</Id><Topic><Title>12 Upgrades this morning for this TURD</Title><Username>spyeman</Username><Timestamp>1359550963754</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:02:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Always buy long and take a chance</Msg><Username>smartybob569</Username><Timestamp>1359553620429</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:47:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359553635146-208</Id><Topic><Title>Amazon - the bear killer</Title><Username>brucetheharmonicaguy</Username><Timestamp>1359552486707</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:28:06 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Roman empire...great analogy.

This AM we just found out the econmy shrank for the 4th quarter and unemployment is above 8%. But, this stock is up 10% because their profit margin went up 0.8%? Despite this "huge" profit they still couldnt make the bottom line. This guys is why the retail investor has to figure out what the big boys are doing-all other math is a waste of time. Those Big boys are all in here and they will defend it until the big sell off.....This is a retailer. Period. they have a dsitribution channel that is innovative etc...but that is it. They run on a 3.5% Gross Profit margin and that will not get much better anytime soon. No retailer keeps a 100 P/e for long.........BUT...you have to wait until the Hegies decide they have had enough.....that is how this game is played.</Msg><Username>finplan95</Username><Timestamp>1359553965728</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:52:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359554001040-217</Id><Topic><Title>Help me understand.

This stock closed up 3.6% to $3.15 on Tuesday. Tuesday's Range: $3.01-$3.21 52-Week Range: $2.22-$5.34 Volume: 6.07 million Three-Month Average Volume: 3.76 million From a technical perspective, DVAX spiked higher here right off its 50-day moving average of $2.92 with massive upside volume. This move is quickly pushing shares of DVAX within range of triggering a major breakout trade. That trade will hit if DVAX manages to take out some near-term overhead resistance at $3.39 with high volume. Traders should now look for long-biased trades in DVAX as long as it’s trending above its 50-day at $2.92, and then once it sustains a move or close above $3.39 with volume that hits near or above 3.76 million shares. If that breakout triggers soon, then DVAX will set up to re-fill some of its gap down zone from last November that started around $4.75. Some possible upside targets if DVAX gets into that gap are its 200-day at $3.90 to $4.25.</Msg><Username>arawfrejunk</Username><Timestamp>1359554952458</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:09:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359555086565-252</Id><Title>Pigazon - 40 buck stock at most.</Title><Msg>Forty buck stock at most.</Msg><Username>bankruptusablogspot</Username><Timestamp>1359555086565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:11:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359555174153-253</Id><Topic><Title>Pigazon - 40 buck stock at most.</Title><Username>bankruptusablogspot</Username><Timestamp>1359555086565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:11:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Do you trade AMZN, or do you just tell us traders how stupid we are as we keep making money?</Msg><Username>brucetheharmonicaguy</Username><Timestamp>1359555174153</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:12:54 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359555194558-254</Id><Topic><Title>Pigazon - 40 buck stock at most.</Title><Username>bankruptusablogspot</Username><Timestamp>1359555086565</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:11:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>your post makes no sense</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1359555194558</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:13:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359555242587-255</Id><Title>FAIR VALUE PE 35 ABOUT $60 PER SHARE REST IS SPECULATION DAYTRADERS AND EXTRAPOLATIONS DREAMS</Title><Msg>ITS YOUR MONEY GUYS</Msg><Username>kelly_tankor81</Username><Timestamp>1359555242587</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:14:02 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359555285564-256</Id><Title>Buy FB, not this junk who missed big going forward OSTK, no profit nothing</Title><Msg>nothing at all.</Msg><Username>listen_jockers</Username><Timestamp>1359555285564</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:14:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359555288482-257</Id><Topic><Title>What's the chances this Pump Job opens lower tomorrow?</Title><Username>gambling2m</Username><Timestamp>1359504166490</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 19:02:46 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I guess i can be right sometimes lol.</Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1359555288482</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:14:48 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359555319272-258</Id><Topic><Title>Enron, Lehman, Madoff and AMZN, all ponzi sheme</Title><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359552037662</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 08:20:37 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should be trading at $40 and would be still overvalued!</Msg><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359555319272</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:15:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359555343602-259</Id><Title>PEG Ratio of 62</Title><Msg>Too scared to go short, too scared to go long.

Growth is already slowing. I have seen only one downgrade so far and per CNBC there have been about 7 increased price targets. This is all well orchestrated. It's a crowd mentality you see with most bubbles. When you already have all your clients in the stock or many of them and the company fails to meet estimates yet again and guides down again and you need a bigger fool to buy the stock, what do you do? You raise the price target. They'll love it until they hate it. I'm not sure if we'll see any fade today from the huge gap up open, but let's see what is happening about an hour into the day. That gap will need to close or mostly close at some point. I'm not talking about $260.35 because the real close was about $8 higher. Although there is also a small gap at 259.xx from a previous analyst upgrade. Let the games begin.

Answering that query has propelled the career of Gene Munster, a research analyst at Minneapolis brokerage firm Piper Jaffray . For the better part of a decade, Munster, 40, has consistently urged investors to put money into Apple, and he’s been right: The shares have gone from $16.25, when he first recommended them in June 2004, to $628 on April 10. In 2012 alone, the stock is up 56 percent, adding $208 billion to Apple’s market value. At almost $600 billion, Apple is by far the most highly valued company in the world.Now Munster is upping the ante, calling for Apple to reach $1,000 a share by 2014 and become the first U.S. company worth $1 trillion. (Beijing-basedPetroChina crossed that mark for a day in November 2007.) </Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1359557613333</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:53:33 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359557685180-325</Id><Topic><Title>Crowded trades never work</Title><Username>zachattack1041</Username><Timestamp>1359557354587</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:49:14 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>The short interest here is low.

And the margin is terrible. It's only slightly less terrible than it was last qtr. At some point, reality will set in. It has to and always does eventually. When it does, Bezos will have to either provide share-holder value instead of share-holder promises or the stock will adjust to typical multiples afforded a retailer such as Target and Walmart. If it's the latter (and if the economy turns soon, that's more likely), then the adjustment to reality will suck all the air out of AMZN space-helmets overnight. If it's the former, then AMZN will still be worth less than it is today. So it's hard to feel like AMZN will be the first ever stock to avoid realism of the market. Eventually it finds the real value and enforces it.

Sure, Amazon has great and huge revs but where are the profits? Someday, sometime, a business has to be at least nicely profitable to be valuable, as the supermarket-low profit margins of Amazon do not warrant anywhere near its high stock price and p/e! I buy from Amazon too, like everyone else, but would never invest in it due to those thin margins and low profits. And, all the while, AAPL continues to suffer on the Street.

The DOW has maintained its strength but after 4 days of trying the bulls have not been able to accomplish that yet. The index got up to 13969 yesterday and today has been up to 13966 but no "cigar" yet. As how this affects AMZN, I do believe it will affect it ultimately but tops like this usually take weeks to form completely. It is interesting to note that the stock got up to 284.20 today and the previous high seen on Friday was 283.99. If the bulls are unable to get farther above today's high and the stock fails, it will become a "double top" and that could signal that no further upside will be seen.</Msg><Username>luckyone581</Username><Timestamp>1359567276046</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:34:36 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359567312749-642</Id><Topic><Title>Topeka Capital’s Victor Anthony Raises Amazon Target To $360</Title><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1359565209445</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:00:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>If we had cleaned up the system in 2008 , people like this wouldn't have jobs.

Anxieties build; hence, implied volatility goes up. Sometimes way up. IV drives option prices higher. Now that the earnings are out, people stop buying them which translates into cheaper option pricing. Straddle is good for some circumstances, but for earning plays, option traders sell option contracts into earnings for high IV values. Because contracts are more expensive to sell and cheaper to buy and options don't need precise stock pricing to win (in many cases). Buying options prior to earnings generally are riskier than selling them.</Msg><Username>hb5fa_2</Username><Timestamp>1359568655236</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:57:35 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359568795311-657</Id><Topic><Title>THIS MISS EARNING NUMBERS BY 7 CENT PER SHARE, THEY CAME IN A 21 CENT EARNING PER SHARES ANALYSTWASECPECTING EARNING OF 28 CENT PER SHARE .DOWNGRADE COULD BE COMING</Title><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1359558677305</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:11:17 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>A scary scary downgrade crash crash coming could crash $50</Msg><Username>panpeterpeter875</Username><Timestamp>1359568795311</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:59:55 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359568890501-658</Id><Topic><Title>Old UNCLE says AMZN heading to 220 in near term..follow me on TWITTER uncle</Title><Username>checking_here</Username><Timestamp>1359567822118</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:43:42 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>what about utube</Msg><Username>xdon69</Username><Timestamp>1359568890501</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:01:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359568932219-659</Id><Topic><Title>Bezos is brilliant</Title><Username>biff4345</Username><Timestamp>1359564338303</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 11:45:38 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't blame Bezos for selling.... he and AMZN management are reporting what I assume are "accurate" numbers. They are certainly not using fuzzy accounting or cooking the books to get wall street to pump up their stock.. Bezos knows the stock should not be this high based on their results. They don't tell you all the actual sales numbers of specific products because the wall street "professionals" continue to give them a pass on that. As long as they don't mention specific product unit sales, the "analyst" can continue raising the target price based on nothing but HOPE and possible profits in the future. The wall street crooks HIGHLIGHT one slightly positive item (margin increase) to justify pushing the price even higher and ignore all the NEGATIVES.. Its all about the $$$ to be made from weekly options by pushing the stock in a totally opposite direction than investment wisdom would dictate. As a result, the stock is totally disconnected from the actual company results and future prospects. You can't beat the wall street favor that AMZN is experiencing at the moment. You can add CRM, NFLX, LNKD and a few others to the wall street favorite category too.</Msg><Username>wuwuwu3</Username><Timestamp>1359568932219</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:02:12 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359569146655-660</Id><Title>Wall Street Analysts are in so deep they can't back out</Title><Msg>Wall Street Analysts are in so deep they can't back out of their long AMZN recommendations. They all have every client in the stock and their reputations are on the line. They also do not want the stock commission gravy train to end on AMZN as it is what is giving them their bonuses. So, they just keep posting all this positive garbage about how great things are when the quarter was absolutely horrible and guidance terrible. Then they raise their price targets as a way to get the idiots to buy more and simply shuffle more overvalued shares around among institutions. It is pathetic. We already went through this stuff in the internet bubble and mortgage backed bond housing crisis. It is always the same old stuff over and over again. Greed and the momentum of the Wall Street profit system takes over.

Other than that I think with sales tax their low cost advantage is over and probably showed in big $ items slowing down last qtr. I bought a Nikon camera at Best Buy online that was slightly cheaper than amazon during Christmas. In streaming they will be competing heavily with NFLX which is investing tons of money and will make little return on investment. For AMZN to compete they will need to do the same thing and that will add nothing to bottom line. In hardware they already sell their stuff at cost or below. Competing with AAPL and Sumsung, Nokia, MSFT, and Blackberry. Good luck there. In AWS they are dealing with a whole list of new competitors. Good luck there. IT will eventually get to what are you willing to pay for an effecient online fulfillment service. Definitely not this multiple. I see this in the 6th Inning. Similar to NFLX when it was in the 200's. BTW I have been also watching those current assets/liabilities. If it continues in this fashion only way for them to continue investing in all those above activities will be to continue issuing debt. 3B is managable with low rates but if they continue borrowing it will be an issue at some point.</Msg><Username>pricewowens</Username><Timestamp>1359571960400</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:52:40 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359572054006-702</Id><Title>BEZO, and Marc (CRM) went to same school #$%$ suckers &amp; company</Title><Msg>are u aware of that?</Msg><Username>shares245</Username><Timestamp>1359572054006</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 13:54:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359572088256-703</Id><Topic><Title>Topeka Capital’s Victor Anthony Raises Amazon Target To $360</Title><Username>ametrosixual</Username><Timestamp>1359565209445</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 12:00:09 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kenji: The breakdown is much more imminent than most realize.

But surprise, surprise, analysts have lined up to upgrade the stock. Even in wierdest case, they have decresed their expectations and increased their target. The real reason behind this is the fact that a huge secondary offering of AMZN is being touted by AMZN management and to get that business, the analysts are forced to give a pat on AMZN back so that it created increased stock price, greated chance of success in seconday offering at a very high stock price for AMZN and in return AMZN is ready to give greater share of comission to the companies these analysts belong. The real story behind AMZN pop is deciet, lies and fraud. Common investors should stay away from this hyped up stock that is nothing by going down to much lower level when the smoke and mirror clears up. There would be investment companies that wouldn't get this business and they would be the first ones to come out and slash their price targets on AMZN.</Msg><Username>hottopics333</Username><Timestamp>1359575905798</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:58:25 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Sell</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359575912465-752</Id><Topic><Title>Look at todays UPGRADES and Reiterates!

But this is normal for most stocks that underperform expectations regardless of whether it is a record breaking quarter or not. The stock gets clobbered. "Long-term Apple will have many challenges, but they have a ton of cash and huge earnings." Cash is less of a factor for a company that doesn't know how to use it appropriately. It is part of the reason Apple has so much cash, they don't spend enough of it. And part of that comes from Jobs' policy to focus only on a small number of products in order to do them very, very well, exceeding what other conventional electronics producers do, which is to spread themselves too thin. Companies that can't put cash to use tend to be priced at lower multiples like MSFT and others. This is where Apple is headed the more and more it begins to resemble MSFT in this way. Ironically, Amazon takes its cash and reinvests it heavily. So they have much less cash in the bak than they would have otherwise in the short-term at least. And shorts take this as a sign of weakness. Nothing could be further from the truth, and the market recognizes this with Amazon. That they have so many great opportunities to invest and expand whereas Apple simply doesn't. "I think the street just doesn't like Tim Cook." No, they don't like it when they fail to meet expectations. Cook failed, if he'd exceeded expectations they'd have loved him. Has nothing to do with him personally. "If they fall in love with the person, like Bezos" No, they fall in love with those who can continue to find great opportunities to expand their business and have a willingness to pursue them aggressively. Bezos just happens to be one of those names that does this best. "Reed Hastings (NFLX)...then they can do no wrong." NFLX just posted something like 70% growth. I think they fell in love with expectations being blown away on Wall Street. Too bad if NFLX shorts got blown away, too. "Obama..." Even if no one fell in love with, you can't make a strong argument that the other side had much to offer and thus giving voters no real reason to overwhelmingly overturn the status quo.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1359575912465</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:58:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359575964226-753</Id><Title>WHEN THEY PULL THE RUG HERE</Title><Msg>STRAIGHT TO 180</Msg><Username>sfvip</Username><Timestamp>1359575964226</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:59:24 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359576028724-754</Id><Topic><Title>15 YEARS NO EARNINGS.

Huh? Gross margins were about 24%, but it isn't really a question of what longs are happy with, but more about how it simply exceeded the expectations built into the stock's pricing prior to earnings. That effects the share price, and since it went up, longs are happy about that. Otherwise, not sure whether all or many of them understand this about margins or not. Many long or short here don't seem to pay much attention to these kinds of details. "I think grocery stores are more profitable" % doesn't matter. Volume matters. Amazon did $22 billion in business last quarter. 3% of $22 billion is better than 4% of something much smaller.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1359576795817</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:13:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359576812349-764</Id><Title>One stock shorts fear off !??</Title><Msg>Is AMZN Big money behind this stock !!!</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1359576812349</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:13:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359576825161-765</Id><Title>Share holders are lucky this one still holding up after the miss</Title><Msg>$250 coming</Msg><Username>jsimon464</Username><Timestamp>1359576825161</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:13:45 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359576833060-766</Id><Title>Something will happen soon.

Permalink Go to topic You let your wife spend all your salary on interior decor because she promises it makes the house worth more?" Huh? Wife? Your wife invests in puts betting against Amazon's new distributions centers and Kindle and AWS expansions and gets wiped out and you think that makes her money losing bets worth more to you? "AAPL could take 3yrs of profits to buy AMZN." How can you buy something that is not for sale? How can you buy anything when your company's policy is to not spend any money? "AAPL cash = blah, blah, blah... AAPL 6yrs of profits + blah, blah, blah..." You sound like an AAPL long who just got his head handed to him and is sooooo jealous of Amazon. Is that what happened? "One day you will throw your chart out the window and study fundamental/value investing....I HOPE." Huh? What chart? Fundamental investing is an utter failure for valuing growth companies. If this is what you are doing, it explains why your shorts have flopped so miserably and why you misplayed 4Q earnings so poorly. You need to keep some of that HOPE for yourself and hope that you learn your lesson sooner than later on that account.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1359577579443</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:26:19 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359577667668-782</Id><Topic><Title>CALL THE CLOSE GANG</Title><Username>sfvip</Username><Timestamp>1359575470986</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 14:51:10 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>267.50</Msg><Username>pschkqitzsough</Username><Timestamp>1359577667668</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:27:47 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359577689457-783</Id><Topic><Title>earnings may matter????????</Title><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1359558898249</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:14:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Guys?</Msg><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1359577689457</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:28:09 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359577712296-784</Id><Title>ANALIST PUMP AND DUMP LIKE AAPL.</Title><Msg>This guys are nuts.</Msg><Username>jsimon464</Username><Timestamp>1359577712296</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:28:32 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359577722754-785</Id><Topic><Title>Goldman mafia is biggest short seller, today.</Title><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359577079095</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:17:59 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>They did the same with Apple!</Msg><Username>sh0rtmimi</Username><Timestamp>1359577722754</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:28:42 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359577843926-786</Id><Topic><Title>How Do Ya Sell $61 BILLION and NOT Even Earn 1 Penny???</Title><Username>debbie_downer_does_dallas</Username><Timestamp>1359577480818</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:24:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Easy Debbie, you spend all the money you make.</Msg><Username>brucetheharmonicaguy</Username><Timestamp>1359577843926</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 15:30:43 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359577912743-787</Id><Title>Amzn business model= they lose money, pensions give em more:) You see,</Title><Msg>The more money amzn looses, the more money pension funds pony up.

Based on what data? A fantasy? "I think the high for 2013 was reached blah, blah, blah..." Yes, shorts thought the same around this time when the stock went up to near $195 around earnings last January, too. But the stock ended the year at $276. Always bet against the shorts and you'll do quite well. "just look at the cash sitting on the balance sheet - lowest point reletive to sales in years." Cash just sitting doesn't bode well for a stock as Apple investors have learned. Cash needs to be used to expand the company if opportunity exists as it does with Amazon. Shorts don't realize how to interpret this ratio. "I wouldn't be surprised if they need to go back to credit markets by 3rd quarter" And I wouldn't be surprised if they did, the markets were happy to give it to them, and the stock went up a lot, too. How does this bode well if you're short at these levels?</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1359581535505</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:32:15 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359581536093-843</Id><Title>Orderly Exit has begun.....Your PUTS may actually be worth something.....</Title><Msg>Big Boys(Professionals) are just unloading to the retail public.....This balloon is starting to deflate.

No, WMT is growing slower and will continue to lose growth opportunities to Amazon and others and so they are both valued accordingly. "the cost structure moves against it in Q1 and Q2... " Doesn't matter, hardly anyone pays attention to sequentials, except shorts that cherry pick them and lose money. "Maybe AMZN will do another offering without disclosing its true cash position at the specific time of the offering..." They did that already and the stock only went up. And up a lot.

Really, so content costs are going to go down as well right? Fact is AMZN is becoming more and more of a brick and mortar company but it is valued as a great growth prospect even though it is a large cap with no earnings. The valuation should be similar to TGT, WMT, not some $5 billion market cap company that is just starting out. "3 % of $22 billion is better than 4% of something much smaller." wish they could achieve that, this insanity would make more sense.

Average cover - TBD gainz No sybil doez not make 60%, 80%, 200% a year and pig flix waz highly unusual (even more could have been made), but sybs iz typically good for a kool 15-20% / year.... Sybil doez not play optionz - ever... Sybs KISS method of swing trading the underlying, rarely trying to day trade or 'time' the market (except ah reporting day, sybs will swing a healthy 20% of a position in minutes) works like a champ.... Many dopey pumperz hoot and holler at sybs while shorts are working against sybil, but in the end az a pig stock iz tanking the paper trading pumperz dissappear az old sybby cashez out nice fvck in gainz.</Msg><Username>sybil_lives</Username><Timestamp>1359584236124</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:17:16 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359584376536-870</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN could test 283 again tomorrow.</Title><Username>geegenjar</Username><Timestamp>1359582271841</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:44:31 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Or more likely $260.

You could call it "Week-End at Bezos". It was like when a stock fund had such a huge position in CSCO, that they effectively trapped themselves with a huge loss. The same for AMZN, CRM, WDAY(there's a real winner-$9 billion MC, loses $50 million on $100 million in sales).

They are, in fact. Read the 10Q. Cost of Sales grew 16% while revenue grew 22%. "Fact is AMZN is becoming more and more of a brick and mortar company but it is valued as a great growth prospect" What does more and more mean? Does it mean going from 2% to 2.1% of a B&amp;M company? You must be unfamiliar with the facts and figures. For ever sq.ft. of B&amp;M Amazon adds they generated 3 times as much business as Walmart does with similar capacity. "wish they could achieve that, this insanity would make more sense" Why would they want to with so much opportunity to exploit instead? "you have gotten lucky even though AMZN has no blah, blah..." Huh? Does this mean your misplays and losses are simply due to you being simply unlucky? I think it is a lot more than that. "Tell us when that date is?" Why does it matter if I know some precise date. That's the whole point about investing, is that no one knows precise dates. Now shorts here seem to think they do. Like if Amazon doesn't produce a profit of X by date Y then the stock will plunge for good. My success has been based on betting against those predictions of "dates" so I think I'll just keep betting against the shorts and their obsession with a precise date.</Msg><Username>nemesis_editor_2007</Username><Timestamp>1359586024695</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:47:04 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359586138304-882</Id><Topic><Title>Many inside traders shorted between 280-275</Title><Username>dad_bargarow</Username><Timestamp>1359582798849</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:53:18 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think will see $300 in a week or so will finish the year at 350 it has been proven many many times over the years shorting amzn will always make anyone broke</Msg><Username>trader1redart</Username><Timestamp>1359586138304</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:48:58 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359586333270-883</Id><Title>Schmuck insurance is not working today</Title><Msg>short this Bublehead stock to 180 or lower</Msg><Username>sfvip</Username><Timestamp>1359586333270</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 17:52:13 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359586505990-884</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN 2014 Analyst estimate EPS- $4</Title><Username>kenji100</Username><Timestamp>1359582193413</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 16:43:13 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Kenji: Ignore the noise of the short cheerleaders and get smart.

As I said in another post, Amazon is the future of retail. They will basically own the retail world. Back in November of 2008, there was a regular poster on the Walmart board who was telling me that Amazon was way overpriced at $38 and that Walmart was way underpriced at $52. The poster had zero vision of the future and can't figure out that Walmart just keeps shooting itself in the foot and gets hurt each time it does. They are also so focused in the present that they're destroying their future. Great if you're in top management trying to pad your bonus but bad for long term stock holders. In ten to fifteen years from now, Amazon will basically be able to print money and they're laying the groundwork for that now.

There's a show me the profits time coming for this stock after trading years ahead of the profit it hasn't made but forecasted for the past few years. The stock price right now is a product of the easy money being printed by the Fed that is leveraged to the hilt after 4 years of doing it. Now is not the times to buy AMZN for the longterm. What we do know: is alot of comapanies at stock market top areas are the future going back to the Nifty Fifty of the top of 1973; but it took a generation and the Country to get it's act togehter off of reducuing leverage in 1982 to get them going.
