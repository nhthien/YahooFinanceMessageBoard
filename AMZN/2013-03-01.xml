AMZN is poster child for this phenomenon. Wasted investment in digital content, devices and other services. The so called investment phase that started years ago hasn't and won't pay dividends - gross margin games are keeping the dream alive but like in all cases the wheel of reality grinds slow but will grind fine one day. when profits never show up and growth slows to a crawl (see 1Q13 projections for proof) the value of the company must be alligned to reality. growth has declined some 60% and although 18% yoy is great for most retail - the writing on the wall is ever more ominous given the context of the 122B market cap. they really don't have an answer to this problem and with more and more facilities and employess and new investment strategies, the wall gets higher and higher. there is not an easy exit strategy here and they don't even consider some viable options b/c of flawed ethos of growth beyond everything else. what's really amazing is we have so much good data on this company and its markets yet the no see/hear/speak monkey is in full display.</Msg><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1362114626849</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 00:10:26 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362115590705-2</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN stock seems very sensitive to upside bids today: the momo gamblers are in the sandbox the last two days after it was hit down to 255-6</Title><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1362067826894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 11:10:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FED will fail.... interesting, but FED will own the near 100% of all residential promissory notes by 2016.</Msg><Username>cash_back_7</Username><Timestamp>1362115590705</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 00:26:30 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362115925655-3</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN stock seems very sensitive to upside bids today: the momo gamblers are in the sandbox the last two days after it was hit down to 255-6</Title><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1362067826894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 11:10:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>very on the mark post - however I really think Bernanke is not protecting the banking cartel as much as he actually thinks the wealth effect of higher prices will lift us out of the mud and mire and put us on a firm stand. he really believes this in his heart of hearts. i'm a little surprised he doesn't get that there is no free lunch and the cost is lower currency value, higher costs and the most damaging - continuation of increasing debt load.</Msg><Username>dutchboyinvestor</Username><Timestamp>1362115925655</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 00:32:05 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362117199822-4</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN stock seems very sensitive to upside bids today: the momo gamblers are in the sandbox the last two days after it was hit down to 255-6</Title><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1362067826894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 11:10:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Should have been specific.

That's a gross misallocation of capital via paper engineering: and puts the flow of money into a hands of fews at the expense of most. And it's proven to NOT be sustainable longterm. If they had not created these asset bubble via over debt issuance, this Country would not have a deflation problem to begin with. It's all their "estimating" with BS models that are a big part of it. Your supposed to let markets clear the system, the Fed's policies get in the way of that: and keep funnelling money in the direction of their "overseers" creating very shaky unpinning, foundations to the system here. Now bond yields have to stay below 2 % to keep the debt behomoth from imploding.</Msg><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1362134054931</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 05:34:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362134301684-10</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN stock seems very sensitive to upside bids today: the momo gamblers are in the sandbox the last two days after it was hit down to 255-6</Title><Username>party_bistro</Username><Timestamp>1362067826894</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-02-28 11:10:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's not realizing anyting: he'll blow the asset bubble as high as he can get it in favor of the banks until it implodes: just like the housing and tech ones of 2000 and 2007.

It better hope no one decides to act like an investor rebalance between Amazon and Apple to reflect fundamentals (which would put the relative weighting at about 10 $ AAPL to $1 AMZN).

It doesn't need to sell at a record pace... If it could simply hold profits close to these levels, that is a pretty extraordinary cash flow yield in this environment. While AAPL has earnings risk (as everyone does), it has the cash to weather any storm and, actually, can deploy that cash for strategic acquisitions once the bubble bursts. It would survive for years with no revenue (most of the mfg cost lie elsewhere with partners...). Plus, its global earnings make it a real currency hedge as well... Amazon OTOH.... Apple can and should sit on its cash and let WS beat it down.

If I were on the BOD, I would double the dividend, and then buy back $80B worth of stock (~ 20% of the company, or 185M shares). Removing 20% of the shares, with a 2x increase of dividend, results in only a 60% increase in payout, even though you increase the yield by 100%. The stock will get back to $550 in a hearbeat with increased demand and lack of supply. The amazing thing is that they would still have $57B in cash, and only about 40% of FCF tied up in the increased dividend.</Msg><Username>once_on</Username><Timestamp>1362177783060</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 17:43:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362177840261-101</Id><Topic><Title>AMZN CEO Buying Shares!</Title><Username>kirk.gallardo</Username><Timestamp>1362154528025</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 11:15:28 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>good report</Msg><Username>cartermarc24</Username><Timestamp>1362177840261</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 17:44:00 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362179483041-102</Id><Topic><Title>Crooks at again ...This will clos below $2.65 option money go poof</Title><Username>halljohn471</Username><Timestamp>1362165480027</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 14:18:00 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>if you believe it will finish at that level then write naked calls and puts,, take the easy cash then. it all expires at zero</Msg><Username>bomber1000us</Username><Timestamp>1362179483041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 18:11:23 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1362179559496-103</Id><Title>bull run all year,,,not everywhere</Title><Msg>if i recall aapl was 700 AMZN was 280 recentl\y, so not everyone is believing in the bull, trade it daily or you lose</Msg><Username>bomber1000us</Username><Timestamp>1362179559496</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 18:12:39 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1362184654788-104</Id><Topic><Title>Has Sybil been broken by Amazon &amp; Netflix?</Title><Username>beauty.seeker32</Username><Timestamp>1362171146660</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-03-01 15:52:26 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Yo stinky Jr.!!!
