Detectives had been monitoring the group before Thursday's shootout in Laplace in which two deputies were killed and two more wounded, said DeSoto Parish Sheriff Rodney Arbuckle. His detectives and other law enforcement discovered the suspects were heavily armed adherents to an ideology known as the "sovereign citizens" movement. The FBI has classified "sovereign citizens" as people who believe they are free from all duties of a U.S. citizen, like paying taxes.

I have a friend whose daughter just graduated from college and she related that many of her co-eds are not finding work in their related fields. They blame Obama. Like most kids their age they were not politically motivated prior to this election. They've gotten a reality check and are now eager to use that vote even if only in protest. Obama is not convincing the next generation that he can meet the challange of putting things right. So far, he's just offered coulda, woulda, shoulda, blaming the other side. That only goes so far and people start to look at what has changed.....worse was not the deal. *** Obama is losing the young vote. He's lost older Americans too. His approval among those over 40 is 35%. Few people are enthusiatic about voting for him again. It's time for a regime change. Obama has done nothing for the last 2 years. Navy SEALS did the heroic work and he took the credit.

Bush arguing for more stimulus to boost a slow economy in the early 2000s, Ryan's economic analysis was entirely different. "What we're trying to accomplish today with the passage of this third stimulus package is to create jobs and help the unemployed," Ryan said, in comments unearthed by MSNBC's "Up with Chris Hayes" and provided to HuffPost. "What we're trying to accomplish is to pass the kinds of legislation that when they've passed in the past have grown the economy and gotten people back to work."

Compared to Reagan in 1981, Obama inherited less unemployment, far less inflation and dramatically lower interest rates! And today, nearly FOUR years later, Obama has done Jack to fix it... save for wasting Trillions on "Crony Phony Capitalism", fruitless Green Garbage, corrupt Union Bosses, useless Bail-Outs, a Stupid Nation Building War in Afghanistan, and beyond all that, begging the FED to plow in more and more Trillions! Trillions &amp; Trillions of Taxpayer dollars have now been swept down the Obama sewer and today, we are at $16,000,000,000,000 (TRILLION!!) in DEBT... the greatest explosion of DEBT in World History!! Moreover... as to the "Financial Crisis", it was Democrats (Obama prominently among them!!) who were clearly at the CENTER of the Mortgage Debacle... for over a Decade, pumping, humping and legislating garbage underwriting of Mortgages by Banks, ubiquitous bundling of Mortgage Backed Securities and crazy use of Credit Default Swaps, all deliberately intended to put Tens of Millions of homes into the hands of Tens of Millions of Dead-Beats! Indeed, the GOP Congress tried to stop the Fannie Freddie "Suicide on America" in the 2004-05... and the Democrats threatened a filibuster and killed it!! And it worked... at least until the Housing Market exploded a couple years later... at nuclear levels! "Inherited A Mess"... not even close!! But the Democrat Press &amp; Media love to spew this lie 24/7/365! The "Bush Recession" was moderate, at worst, and it ended in June of 2009... and when it comes to "The Financial Mess", the Democrat Party was at its very core!!! The truth is that it is the NEXT President who will "Inherit A Real Mess"... God help us, in January 2013!!</Msg><Username>econ_meister</Username><Timestamp>1345396676000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-19 13:17:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345397061000-35</Id><Topic><Title>Obama Inherited MUCH LESS Of A Mess Than Reagan!

What you fail to get in that maggot invested brain of yours, during Reagan's term, homes were being bought and sold with regularity, jobs were plentiful then. Very few foreclosures due to a backlash of defaults. Back then, your house wouldn't have been on the market for a year or more, there were plenty of buyers. Today, not so much. Even lower interest rates are not enticing people. The idiot Dems are 100% responsible for your predicament. You have a house you can't sell, you can't borrow on it. The banks have so many dead homes, the contracted realtors are over stocked with short sales. They'll get rid of those before yours. Thank Barney.
