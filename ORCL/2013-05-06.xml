Apparently the Benghazi cover up (and that's what it is) is all about protecting Hillary (and Obama too), as she prepares to run for prez in '16, from criticism that Sec of State she ignored prior warnings about an attack. So all this rigamaroll is about politics and that's all?

John Sampson (Democrat) was taken into custody this morning following a public corruption probe, an FBI official has confirmed. Sampson of Brooklyn turned himself in to authorities after being ensnared in a bribery scandal involving former colleague-turned-rat Shirley Huntley, sources said. He is currently at the FBI's New York headquarters at 26 Federal Plaza in Lower Manhattan. Sampson is expected to be arraigned this afternoon in Brooklyn federal court. Loretta Lynch, the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York, will hold a press conference later this morning at her office in downtown Brooklyn. The move comes after authorities last week revealed that wiretaps show an unnamed state senator — whom sources identified to The Post as Sampson — allegedly helped broker an illicit deal between Huntley and a cargo company at JFK Airport in March 2012. As The Post revealed Saturday, the federal probe into allegedly crooked Queens and Brooklyn pols has already led to other investigations into Sampson and US Congressman Gregory Meeks (D-Queens).</Msg><Username>liberals_plague_humanity</Username><Timestamp>1367846251130</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:17:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1367846501195-19</Id><Title>Hillary proclaimed...'what difference does it make'... at Benghazi hearing</Title><Msg>Could not be anymore hypocritical since she was on the Nixon witch hunt... which of course was a cover-up for political purposes</Msg><Username>central_scrutinizer_fz</Username><Timestamp>1367846501195</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-05-06 09:21:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1367847302581-20</Id><Topic><Title>Benghazi is about politics?

"In 2002, the George W. Bush administration urged Congress to enact the American Dream Down Payment Assistance Act, which subsidized down payments of homebuyers whose income was below a certain level. Bush also urged Congress to pass legislation requiring the Federal Housing Administration to make zero-down-payment loans at low-interest rates to low income Americans." Bush, 2002 THE PRESIDENT: Thank you, all. Thanks, for coming. Well, thanks for the warm welcome. Thank you for being here today. I appreciate your attendance to this very important conference. You see, we want everybody in America to own their own home. That’s what we want. This is – an ownership society is a compassionate society. More and more people own their homes in America today. Two-thirds of all Americans own their homes, yet we have a problem here in America because few than half of the Hispanics and half the African Americans own the home. That’s a homeownership gap. It’s a – it’s a gap that we’ve got to work together to close for the good of our country, for the sake of a more hopeful future. We’ve got to work to knock down the barriers that have created a homeownership gap. I set an ambitious goal. It’s one that I believe we can achieve. It’s a clear goal, that by the end of this decade we’ll increase the number of minority homeowners by at least 5.5 million families.
