Under current rules, some wealthy individuals are able to accumulate many millions of dollars in these accounts, substantially more than is needed to fund reasonable levels of retirement saving. The budget would limit an individual’s total balance across tax-preferred accounts to an amount sufficient to finance an annuity of not more than $205,000 per year in retirement, or about $3 million in 2013. This proposal would raise $9 billion over 10 years. This is highly illustrative as it reveals further what Obama thinks. The gall to think that he knows what is reasonable for someone else's retirement. The gall to thumb his nose at many who have saved for decades and accumulated sigificant sums and tell them that 205k is all they need for retirement. I have to think that even libs, except Mesa, would have a problem with this.</Msg><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1365594268098</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 07:44:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1365596013085-5</Id><Title>"They deserve a vote" dems are saying..........I gotta point out.dems have prevented votes, right?</Title><Msg>It should be easier to get a vote for both parties and both have blocked votes for political reasons right?</Msg><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365596013085</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 08:13:33 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365596320432-6</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's proposed budget would limit retirement income</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1365594268098</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 07:44:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>UNTRUE!

The preview promises that President Barack Obama's budget 'reduces the deficit and puts the Nation on a sound fiscal course.' 'Every new initiative in the plan is fully paid for, so they do not add a single dime to the deficit,' the White House pledges. An initial walk through the budget proposals, however, suggests that Republicans in Congress will need some convincing. The budget will hit congressional offices less than 24 hours after the government's top watchdog agency declared that nearly $100 billion was wasted last year in duplicative and overlapping programs stretching into every corner of the Washington bureaucracy.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1365600460401</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 09:27:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365600471162-21</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's proposed budget would limit retirement income</Title><Username>seeburgc</Username><Timestamp>1365594268098</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 07:44:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you are so dishonest. it is a FACT that the top tax rate then was 91%... and mr. weasel, did I not clarify that by showing that the top 400 returns THEN paid an effective rate of about 50%........ get it? the top marginal rate now is much lower, 39 or so percent.......and the top 400 returns paid and effective rate of 16.6%.......do notice how much the effective rate has fallen.... nor do not fail to notice that since 1961 corporations have cut THEIR taxes by half.......... is that what you call the spread of communism? the lower taxes paid by the rich now and the increased take of the nation's total income?

Vice President Biden didn't appear to be sitting with her, as far as pool could tell. Our view of the audience was partially blocked. Some funny comments from Ken Ehrlich, the executive producer of the show -- As he was warming up the audience before the show started, he said so many of the night's songs would feature hits by Otis Redding that he has dubbed the event "Otis for POTUS." He then led the audience in practicing their synchronized clapping to a recorded version of "Respect." Afterward, Ehrlich said he was "particularly proud of all the white people. I think we really proved something ... and we're going to keep proving it all night." When POTUS and FLOTUS were about to come into the room, the lighting around the stage turned to a vibrant purple. President Obama walked into the room to the Booker T. Washington and the MG's 60s mod classic "Green Onions." When he got to the mike, he said: "I'm in my second term now so rather than 'Hail to the Chief,' we're going with that (referring to the Green Onions song)...from here on out. A little change in tradition." Obama then announced the engagement of two White House staffers, Kenny Thompson, the director of Vice President Joe Biden's messaging, and Jess Wright, White House director of scheduling. He said the two of them had worked for him since Iowa in 2007. "I'm going to exercise a little presidential prerogative to say a few words about two very special people who are here tonight...this is going to embarrass them," he said. "Over the weekend, Kenny popped the question and Jess said yes," he said.</Msg><Username>atomicquark</Username><Timestamp>1365601213104</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 09:40:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365601265281-26</Id><Topic><Title>gun nuts shoot 20,000 people a year in the USA by accident</Title><Username>delucks345</Username><Timestamp>1365597683662</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 08:41:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama Administration Ships 140,000 Tear Gas Canisters to Egypt’s Muslim Brotherhood Regime Posted by Gateway Guest Blogger on Wednesday, April 10, 2013, 2:11 AM Guest Post by Mara Zebest Shouldn’t we be able to see an audit of every taxpayer dollar spent on the Muslim Brotherhood?

Since February of 2009, the first full month of Obama's presidency, there have been 70,291,049 background checks for gun purchases, according to data released by the FBI. Using February 1, 2009 as our starting date, and March 31, 2013 as our end date, (the latest data from the FBI) Obama has been president for 1,520 days. That equates to 36,480 hours, or 2,188,800 minutes.

We held several "punch ins" on the creeps in the streets with their commie flags calling for "Victory For The Viet Cong." It was fun watching these traitors run like rabbits from a handful of military vets.</Msg><Username>lewcor</Username><Timestamp>1365645758003</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 22:02:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1365647159466-106</Id><Topic><Title>Ironically, both sets of parents are registered, voting democrats. says assbuckroo</Title><Username>dropkickpubs4321</Username><Timestamp>1365635924657</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-10 19:18:44 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I didn't say that, you halfwitted DA.
