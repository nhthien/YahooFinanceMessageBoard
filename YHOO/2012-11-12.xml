Yahoo Inc which sold a partial stake in Alibaba back to the privately-owned group in September, still holds 24 percent of Alibaba. According to a Yahoo filing to the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission on Thursday, Alibaba Group's net attributable income for the quarter was $273 million, up 129 percent from a year ago. Revenue rose 71 percent to $1.1 billion. Alibaba's profit for the first nine months of the year was up more than 300 percent to $730.4 million, while revenue was up 74 percent to $2.9 billion. Alibaba's soaring growth reflects the underlying boom in China's e-commerce industry that was worth 278.84 billion yuan ($45 billion) in gross transaction value in the second quarter. Alibaba said it recorded its highest one-day gross transaction value, at 19.1 billion yuan ($3.06 billion), on Sunday. ($1 = 6.2450 Chinese yuan)</Msg><Username>thetoadtimes</Username><Timestamp>1352696548738</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-11-12 00:02:28 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1352699604293-2</Id><Title>Ok let me get this straight.

Remember there are only so many shares available to trade on the open market. Remember most of the institutions are in this for the long haul especially doing the numbers with the $22b put under this stock for cash, Alibaba, and Yahoo Japan. There are many long term individual investors. 73% institution ownership, and with my estimates about 15% long term individual investors which leaves only 12% of the float available to trade at these prices. That means there are only 120+ million shares to buy at these levels. I don't think yahoo will accumulate many shares under $19. It takes a long time to accumulate that many shares and doesn't happen in a couple months. It is harder to buy back large amounts of stock on the open market without a price spike..
