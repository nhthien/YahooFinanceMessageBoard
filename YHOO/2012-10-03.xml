You will get fewer shares and each share representing a larger part of the company but the company is worth less. Yahoo loses value by buying and retiring shares. The cash used is no longer a part of Yahoo. Just like the last $3 billion buyback did nothing for the share price.

AOL's sure did. It has to be a big and well directed buy back, (Dutch aution?). With interest rates so low, (i.e. YHOO can't earn much on cash and can borrow cheaply) and YHOO having assets that they don't seem to get fair market credit for (i.e. undervalued) to buy back shares at this level would be a big boost.

Question: If I can find and report 200 spam posts in 15 minuets; Why do the posts continue to exist and are moved back to the top of the message board, each time another spammer responds to it? It appears that these posts continue to exist and are really an extreme nuisance. Each spam post has something in common with hundreds of other spam posts and are easily located.
