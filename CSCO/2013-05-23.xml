Fox show brings messy workplaces to television May 22, 1:25 PM (ET) By DAVID BAUDER NEW YORK (AP) - This time "you're fired" is more than a Donald Trump catchphrase. Fox is turning the firing of real people from real jobs into prime-time entertainment starting this week. The network on Thursday will begin airing "Does Someone Have to Go?" a series where cameras go into small businesses and employees are compelled to rat out underperforming colleagues. At the end, they choose one co-worker to recommend for firing. "This is the thing they promise to do in retreats but nobody really does it," said Mike Darnell, executive in charge of alternative programming for Fox. Darnell and Fox have pushed the boundaries of reality TV since it was first recognized as a genre, from the highs of "American Idol" to the lows of "Who Wants to Marry a Multimillionaire?" He said he sees "Does Someone Have to Go?" as a new direction for a programming form dominated by singing and dancing competitions. It's a revamped version of a show, then called "Someone's Gotta Go," that Fox had been working on with the Endemol production company four years ago. In its initial incarnation, employees were given the power to determine who should be laid off within companies that needed to shrink for economic reasons. The show drew awful advance publicity - one magazine called it a step toward public executions - and never aired. "The network decided the heat was too intense given the economic climate," Darnell said. "We never lost our affinity for the idea."</Msg><Username>alsmith581</Username><Timestamp>1369309678762</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 07:47:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369309827690-10</Id><Topic><Title>The true meaning of "All'ah Hu Akkbar" is...</Title><Username>ivanhoeofloxxly</Username><Timestamp>1369308009272</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 07:20:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>America needs an AMERICAN leader, not an anti-American Kenyan.

The repudiation of the Bush./W. neocon fearmongering against terror here/there/everywhere nonsense that got congress to approve unprecedented invasions of American civil liberties. PUKES like Palin/Beck/Cruz talk about "liberty" and "freedom", but they have no qualms about torture, indefinite incarceration w/o ejudication...i.e habeus corpus The teabaggers have absolutely NO CLUE about the constitution. They are xenophobic, homophobic, fearful losers. The good news is that everyone is becoming aware of it...in a big way. John McCain is condemning the freaks like Rand Paul and Ted Cruz. I hope that they win their primaries for prez in Iowa and NH. The GOP is finished. Now let's neuter the filibuster and DESTROY the POD. Party of Death. Isn't it funny that the deficit is coming down, the stock market rising, and unemployment coming down after the worst economy since the Great Depression caused by the banks and the W. admin.? Bottom line...GOP wants to enslave and they will fail.</Msg><Username>the_verk_knows</Username><Timestamp>1369355234240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 20:27:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1369355628935-227</Id><Topic><Title>The GREAT Barack Obama...President on the United States of America.....delivered</Title><Username>the_verk_knows</Username><Timestamp>1369355234240</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-05-23 20:27:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>He's actually President OF the United States.
