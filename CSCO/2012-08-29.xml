But a recent poll found that Mitt Romney was pulling in 0 percent of the black vote. (The poll had a margin of error of 3 percent.) Love has also been vocal in her disdain for black lawmakers in Congress. Earlier this year, she told the Deseret News that she would join the Congressional Black Caucus if she were elected, and then "take that thing apart from the inside out." She's said that CBC lawmakers "profit from promoting an unsustainable entitlement system rife with failed poverty programs that perpetuates the culture of government dependency and discourages self-reliance among black Americans," and said that black voters need to know that their representatives "want to keep them on the 'government plantation.'"</Msg><Username>allnewquincymagoo7</Username><Timestamp>1346240547710</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 07:42:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346240713926-10</Id><Title>MITT ROMNEY completes the FAILURE in Massachusetts!!</Title><Msg>MITT ROMNEY completes the FAILURE in Massachusetts!!

LOL ue to the slow response to the hurricane, New Orleans's top emergency management official called the effort a "national disgrace" and questioned when reinforcements would actually reach the increasingly desperate city.[9] New Orleans's emergency operations chief Terry Ebbert blamed the inadequate response on the Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA). "This is not a FEMA operation. I haven't seen a single FEMA guy", he said. "FEMA has been here three days, yet there is no command and control. We can send massive amounts of aid to tsunami victims, but we can't bail out the city of New Orleans."[9] In the early morning of September 2 mayor Ray Nagin expressed his frustration at what he claimed were insufficient reinforcements provided by the President and federal authorities.[10][11] However, many police, fire and EMS organizations from outside the affected areas were reportedly hindered or otherwise slowed in their efforts to send help and assistance to the area. FEMA sent hundreds of firefighters who had volunteered to help rescue victims to Atlanta for 2 days of training classes on topics including sexual harassment and the history of FEMA.[12]</Msg><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346248436195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:53:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346248621156-31</Id><Topic><Title>it took Bush 6 days to respond to Katrina</Title><Username>dumb.ivan</Username><Timestamp>1346248436195</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:53:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Ya, the Obama team is looking for Brownie, he's the best</Msg><Username>gfo99</Username><Timestamp>1346248621156</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:57:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346248846885-32</Id><Topic><Title>Cant do anything right.</Title><Username>crankf41</Username><Timestamp>1346246759973</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 09:25:59 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>ELECTION year Dumb Dumb, Election year.......Surely even a dunce like yourself can figure that out.

Greenlight is the hedge fund that David Einhorn started in 1994 with just $300,000 and now has more than 5 billion in assets under management. David Einhorn is one of the most successful long/short equity hedge fund managers of the past decade. David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital returned 15.9% in 2010, and 21.5% since its inception in 1996. Greenlight Capital's market beta is around 0.5, meaning if they didn't have any stock picking skills, they would have returned about half of the market's return.

Currently they are 15+% below their prior peak. During the same period, per capita worker productivity more than doubled, and real, inflation-adjusted economic output/GDP TRIPLED. That's right, during an era when the real, inflation-adjusted economic pie TRIPLED in size, rank-and-file workers' real, inflation-adjusted wages FELL BY FIFTEEN PERCENT. ALL the value of the U.S. society's increased productivity and output (after adjusting for labor force population growth), has gone - and continues to go - to a tiny sliver at the very top of the wealth/income ladder. PLUS ANOTHER 15%+ OF WORKER WAGES. What's more, every major RepubliCONservative policy espoused or implemented during the same period (to name but a few: decreased tax burdens on capital gains, dividends and other "rich guy" income, increased relative tax burden on ordinary income, cuts in the social safety net, "free" trade policies, offshoring, looting of pensions a la Myth RobbedMe, wars fought to benefit Big Oil, attempts to crush collective bargaining and labor unions generally, etc.), has had this as an implicit GOAL. Pointing all this out isn't "classism," not by a long shot. But I certainly understand how it might worry those who have been making out like banditos FOR DECADES from this campaign of stealth guerrilla economic warfare. ------------------------ (*) Incidentally, social/economic class isn't a "suspect/protected" category for equal protection purposes. Race/ethnicity IS, almost definitionally.

Any republican that actually had a sense of civility has either left the party (Olympia Snow) or has been deemed irrelevant by the lunatics.</Msg><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346270622099</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 16:03:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346270734739-112</Id><Topic><Title>REPUKES SPIT ON RON PAUL's FACE</Title><Username>surfandski</Username><Timestamp>1346220028107</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 02:00:28 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Anyone ?

Others thought Romney didn't want to make enemies with Paul in case he needed the Pauliac votes if conservatives stayed home disappointed Rick, or Newt was not chosen. Well everyone was wrong. Paul won't endorse Romney even though his son Rand is speaking today at the convention, and Ron is being treated respectfully. Worse, on the first ballot Nevada's delegation voted for Paul even though Mitt won the votes. Seems that the chair of the state was a Paul person, and the law says they are bound to vote for the winner on the first ballot has been ignored in favor of Paul. The Nevada voters for everyone other than Paul had their vote disenfranchised by this despicable action. Personally I would like each of these Sons of Beeches sued civilly and be fined lots of money.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346283989044</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 19:46:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1346285026621-149</Id><Topic><Title>WHY DOES EVERYONE LIKE RYAN AND ROMNEY SO VERY VERY MUCH?

I don't think Ann will be taking any $500,000 Spanish vacations with scores of friends at the Taxpayers expense. I don't think Ann will have a huge staff , travel separately from Mitt when they are both going to the same place taking different jumbo jets. I don't think Ann will take dozens of vacation costing the taxpayer $10 million dollars a year. I think Ann has class, like Barbra and Laura Bush had, and style like Jackie Kennedy had. I caught Ann's speech on TV last night and she is a person in touch with how fragile life can be, one moment your healthy the next you have horrible illness like she had. Ann raised kids, 5 boys, she wasn't rich back then Romney gave away his inherited wealth. Ann got both Breast Cancer and MS at times during her life. Its going to be a mature Lady that will be our First Lady. A wise woman who is a Lady in more than the Title. I like her more than Mitt, but she helped me appreciate Mitt more last night than listening to Mitt during Two Presidential campaign has. I got the sense that Mitt was a good husband and father, helped his friends without taking credit for the help or asking anything in return. Unlike Obama who make $72,000 per month in book royalties and won't help his Brother who lives in a straw hut in Kenya or his illegal Aunt on welfare in Boston. Obama only want to help others if the government pays for it. He is not a person who is good to friends and family. Ask Oprah. Yes, Ann will be a good person to make forgetting the Wookie easy.</Msg><Username>rhonda_edelstein</Username><Timestamp>1346285026621</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-29 20:03:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1346285619186-150</Id><Title>McCAIN PIMPING FOR DEFENSE GOVERNMENT CONTRACTORS...</Title><Msg>The whole speech is about expanding wars everywhere.
