Believe it or not, it creates the perfect environment for the eventual innovation which will lift us out of it. The idle minds of the workers will busy themselves with pipe dreams, and some of the dreams will become manifest in the economy. I am an inventor. Necessity is the mother of invention. With a high percentage of unemployed people working on gaining a leg up, the probability of innovation grows. OTOH, giving out food stamps, stifles the necessity and urgency. It may not actually happen until after more wealth is distributed in social programs and the democrats run out of options. It is called a Kondratiev economic winter and it waits for innovation to become the spring.</Msg><Username>artemiagrower</Username><Timestamp>1359824812210</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 12:06:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1359824960277-27</Id><Title>Just like Russia</Title><Msg>White House releases a photo of Obama skeet shooting.

Another 1.9 million Americans joined the ranks of food stamp recipients last year, exceeding the total number of jobs created!!! OBAMA TAKES A VICTORY LAP. Knowing this reality, it is baffling to see the market's gullible response to data reported by government agencies that is continually massaged to illicit positive sentiment. Optimism must be grounded in realism. The number of Americans seeking unemployment benefits fell last week to the lowest level in five years according to the Department of Labor, which pundits cited as evidence that employers were cutting fewer jobs-or did it? Initial claims for unemployment insurance declined on a seasonally-adjusted basis to 330k. In reality, the actual number of people filing initial claims was more than 436k. Seasonal adjustments were used to make the number look better.

So it's true. The White House is responding to critics who questioned whether President Obama has ever been skeet shooting. White House Senior adviser Dan Pfeiffer tweeted out the picture on Saturday morning after much skepticism about the president's claim that he participates in the sport "all the time." "POTUS shoots clay targets on the range at Camp David on Aug. 4, 2012," reads the tweet, with a link to the photograph. The photo would appear to quiet the controversy that arose after an interview with The New Republic, in which Obama talked about frequent skeet shooting. The publication asked: "Have you ever fired a gun?" Obama responded: "Yes, in fact, up at Camp David, we do skeet shooting all the time."</Msg><Username>yohoho_andabottlea</Username><Timestamp>1359833339393</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-02-02 14:28:59 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359833598291-48</Id><Topic><Title>DEMOCRAT SENATOR MENENDEZ FACES $50 FINE FOR SEX WITH MINORS IN DOMINICAN REPUBLIC</Title><Username>democrat_cocoon_gay_perversions</Username><Timestamp>1359690023315</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-01-31 22:40:23 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Obama admin Most corrupt administration ever.
