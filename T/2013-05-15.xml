Yesterdays low was lower than the previous low on May 6th and the previous high on May 8th was 3 cents below the prior high. We need to see that pattern reversed before we can be confident that the up trend is continuing. If we get within pennies of $38 before the next downturn it will restore confidence. That hit from $39 was pretty serious. Also volume needs to get back up to 26 million or more. Volume has been below average ever since the 5% one day drop back in April. It reflects the market lacks confidence in the up trend even though T is trading above the 50 DMA.</Msg><Username>wilkes71</Username><Timestamp>1368628685538</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:38:05 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368629124813-16</Id><Title>Tremor du jour</Title><Msg>What’s your tremor du jour, citizen? Hooligans with guns? A twitchy NRA with even more guns? Chechen morons with unregistered cookware? The IRS? Ah, the IRS, doing what the IRS does best: being sort of hateful, targeting various groups it doesn’t like, adding pressure to groups it feels are some sort of threat, nailing little people from whom it feels it can suck some extra dollars. Nothing new there. Except now, now the IRS overstepped even its own ignoble rules in targeting some dumber-than-thou conservative groups, right around the last election. How utterly stupid. How utterly embarrassing. How utterly pointless. Then again, who doesn’t know the IRS targets specific demographics all the time? Who doesn’t know that this is essentially what the IRS does? Do you know how many (liberal, wonderful, not the slightest bit rich or threatening) friends I have who run small businesses that the IRS has decided to audit, for no other reason than it’s far easier to scrape a few bucks from 10,000 little guys than it is to go after one heavily armored, tax-exempt megacorp? Lots, that’s how many. Do you know who’s laughing hardest about the current IRS microscandal? All those giants of industry that escape billions in taxes by way of various loopholes, exemptions, armies of expensive tax attorneys. Carry on, rich people – go get richer. It’s OK, no one’s looking. The worst part of this little IRS scandal? Nope, not that Obama is having another Worst Week Ever. It’s that the Tea Party is suddenly back in the national spotlight, all righteous and spittle-flecked, full of its usual inbred nonsense, when it was all but dead a week ago. Worse still: If the GOP has its way, we’ll be hearing the Tea Party’s nasally shriek through the 2016 elections. Thanks, IRS.</Msg><Username>hotdoggitwiggie</Username><Timestamp>1368629124813</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:45:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368629319393-17</Id><Topic><Title>NIXON</Title><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1368582597725</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 21:49:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I don't care what you call yourselves. Sheesh. Who cares if Glen Beck managed to organize you fools? You were just as ridiculous 20 years ago as you are today. Issa himself ignored Bush' lies about Iraq--completely supported the invasion and never went after him later--and is now going after Obama and Rice for what is very, very fine parsing of words. Not one of you Tea Brains have suggested we seek justice for the 7,000+ soldiers killed in Iraq and Afghanistan for what we know are lies. That is a disgusting level of partisan hypocrisy. Winholder, who said Rice should be jailed, won't even answer the question of whether he is a hypocrite or not. He clearly is. But that only gets to half my point. You birthers and Tea Brains have been on a partisan witch hunt since Obama was elected, from "you lie" to the latest Issa bs. You've been circling Obama like a bunch of gutless hyenas since Jan. 20 2009. I can be certain that no matter the facts your only purpose will be to try to pin something on Obama. At first blush, these appear to be disconcerting but not d***ing incidents that warrant further review--much like Benghazi. These issues do raise serious questions about campaign finance and the balance between national security and press freedom, and the potential for abuse. But you wouldn't know that from the conservative media or the posts here. To you people this is just another opportunity to try to pin something on Obama. And to good *Americans* that is just as disconcerting as the incidents themselves--perhaps even worse--because they point to failings in are Democratic system that are far more pervasive.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368629319393</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 10:48:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368629859477-18</Id><Topic><Title>NIXON</Title><Username>ltcolhen</Username><Timestamp>1368582597725</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-05-14 21:49:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh ricky answer the question .

The importance of Benghazi is that it emphasized activity that has been going on throughout Obama's administration that is detrimental, not only to the United States, but to the whole World. The support of the Muslim Brotherhood is not in the best interest of the United States and that was the function of the Benghazi facility. If the truth were known, it might be that the attack was a defensive measure by the Syrian government. I don't know the truth but certainly support the investigation of it by Congress.

The majority of those involved will do nearly anything; say anything to get what they want or to protect their reputations, even if it is a poor reputation. There is no 'best interest' of the country involved except in their speeches. They will all lie, cheat, steal to accomplish their goals. The only difference this month is that Obama and his crew are about to get caught in some of their lies and shenanigans. The biggest difference in my mind is that the Democrats want the government to control more and more of our everyday lives and that is never a good thing.

He won’t work with Republicans, he asks them to vote with him, or he will go to the people and complain about them. Again, I am not a Tea Party member or supporter. I am a registered independent and have been for about 15 years. A conservative approach to most anything is simply the safer way to go. Liberals want to allow everyone the right to do whatever they want and when they go too far they might try to stop them. That is insane. Liberals spend too much. Their philosophy is that if we need more, we simply go to the people and take it. Too much government and too dishonest government.</Msg><Username>willy_etter</Username><Timestamp>1368649487355</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 16:24:47 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1368650936717-63</Id><Topic><Title>Finally we find out "What difference...does it make?"</Title><Username>froggnot</Username><Timestamp>1368234064090</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-05-10 21:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Perhaps she doesn't realize that the Kenyan has been in charge of this war for the last 5 years and has done nothing.

Hussein's supposed involvement in 9/11? His links to Al-Queda? WMDs? Whatever standard you set for "proving" a lie, Iraq is well beyond whatever happened with Benghazi. They are not even in the same ballpark. There is so much evidence that they lied, intentionally and persistently, I would not even know where to begin. To see someone call Benghazi a lie and pretend Iraq wasn't is simply mind-boggling and depressing. Get your head out of the Tea Brain hole, that's all I can suggest.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1368653180742</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-05-15 17:26:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>7</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1368654675412-66</Id><Title>The frog and the scorpion</Title><Msg>Recently some have become confounded and disappointed by the leadership in Washington. Events such as: o The cover up and disinformation used after the murders and attacks in Benghazi o The intimidation of whistle blowers o The intimidation of conservative groups by the IRS for political purposes o The cover up and disinformation used after the facts about "Fast and Furious" came out o The intimidation of news agencies by the IRS for political purposes o And others There is a famous fable that may shed some light on this quandary: Once upon a time a frog and a scorpion came together at the edge of a lake. As the frog started to swim across the lake, the scorpion asked for some help from the frog; "Oh Mr. Frog, since I can not swim, would you be so kind as to let me ride on your back as you swim across the lake? Mr. Frog responded: "Oh no Mr. Scorpion, I will not do that, because you would sting me with your stinger, and then I would die." To wit Mr. Scorpion said: "Oh no, I would be a fool to do that, because if I did then both of us would parish. Mr. Frog reflected on the logic of his new acquaintance, and since Mr. Frog was good and reasonable individual he agreed to ferry Mr. Scorpion across the lake. After the two had made their way across the lake Mr. Frog screamed after Mr. Scorpion stung him: "Why! Why! Why! did you sting me, because now we both will surely die?" Mr. Scorpion responded: "Oh I know Mr. Frog, I could not help myself, because it is my nature." And there you have it, sometimes people to do things that are not in their best interest just because it is their nature. "In your heart you know he is right."

Someone has an opinion, based on that, the victim is tried, convicted, sentenced and punished on the spot with no law, evidence, or logic.. That's the tea party method of operation.
