Only 10% of Americans think Congress is anything but a gang of thieving racketeers. I can't rember the web site's address but there is one that lists all the large campaign contributions to national office holders. You could find it by trying "Campaign Contributions. You will find common denominators between both Dems. and Reps among those that give them money. The Kenyan's second largest PAC contribution in 2008 was Goldman-Sachs. You now have over 50 ex Goldman-Sachs officers running every facet of government finance. Bernanke=Fed Board, Geithner=Treasury and another one running the IRS. Coincidence? I think not.

Well, now they are." Your humor is sick if that made you laugh. Congress is still not working on this problem. The Republicans are making offers in the media; Obama is refusing them in the media, meaning neither side has likely put much effort into understanding the other. When was the last time you heard anything from Dirty Harry or Nut Job Nancy? How are they involved in any decisions? Zero. This is Obama saying I am going to win regardless of what you want and making his case in the media instead of doing and honest job of negotiating or listening. He certainly isn't leading; he is only posturing and posing. You may call it an anti-Congress rant, but tell me, what actions has Congress taken in the past 6-8 years that have had a positive impact on this county's economy or economy? He is the one blocking. He continually says that unless I get the tax increases I want, I will take the ball and go home. That is his idea of bi-partisanship…I win, you lose.

It's individuals like yourself that have one on one contact with other individuals and impose your opinions on the subconsciouses of others who read what you write. Remember the saying " believe none of what you hear and only half of what you see " ? Like it or not, what you print on this board is just as powerful as what is printed in the paper or said on the TV. I compare ALL posts on a message board as listening to Rush Limbaugh, because they all seem extreme and need to be taken with a grain of salt. Anyone who listens to the media knows that when they are reporting controversial subjects, the reporter will leave an 'out' in the story just in case they are wrong. It sounds like this "" ...and so the glove that was found matches the missing glove of OJ Simpson, what do you think, should the prosecutors charge him with murder? ...

There is alot of testing the waters in the media. For instance, Republicans ran the idea of holding up nominations as a bargaining chip with the whole Susan Rice thing, but it didn't play very well. They're starting to run their next bargaining chip--holding up the debt ceiling--through the media wringer, but that didn't work out for them last time. And they are running their different ideas through the media gamut as well. Unfortunately for Republicans, they just don't have much left to bargain with. But Boehner seems to be methodically attempting to exercise what he does have left. Part of this is learning about how the public may react to these chips, part of this is showing the base and reluctant members that they've used all the chips available. My main worry is that many of the Tea Brain members went back to gerrymandered districts over TG and found a base that hasn't learned a thing. Eventually though Republicans are going to actually have to name their demands publicly. I imagine that outside of the media spotlight, much of the work on a deal has already been done. Going over the fiscal cliff would be the last straw for the Republican party. The party may split permanently if they do. And I think they know that.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1354726311141</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 11:51:51 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354727021559-8</Id><Topic><Title>Norquist Popular With Lib.

From the ARRA to health reform to Dodd-Frank, the legislation that has been passed--almost completely without Republican cooperation--has been far-reaching and historic.

The media isn't saying he did it because it is their role to provide you with information with which you make your own conclusions. They should not provide you with conclusions. In particular, people tend to view trying people (even OJ Simpson) in the media as an abrogation of journalistic integrity. Journalists are not commentators or analysts. Rush Limbaugh is not a journalist, he is a commentator and entertainer. Too many people prefer Rush Limbaughs to tell them what to think to journalists who provide objective information.</Msg><Username>ricky18201</Username><Timestamp>1354727523751</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-12-05 12:12:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354729228842-10</Id><Topic><Title>Say it ain't so.

If I won that Powerball last week, I'd have hundreds of millions squirreled away in offshore accounts just like Romney. What I wouldn't do is think that the best thing for the country is to lower the tax rate on my earnings from those accounts. Understand the difference? It is fine to be rich. It is fine to be poor. It is not fine to think you are entitled to special treatment from the government because of your income level. I choose my leaders based on the policies they prefer and I prefer policies based on what I think is best for the nation, not a particular class. Generally speaking, I think a strong middle class provides a sound basis for a strong economy that in the end benefits everyone, rich, poor or otherwise.

That way when the economy continues to fail, unemployment continues to rise, he will finally have to own his economy. When his plans fail the deficit if unaffected, unemployment is still a major problem, and his Arab Spring continues to escalate into a regional war, no one will vote for another Democrat for decades. If the Republicans continue to fight for their budgets, cuts, limiting increases and the economy continues to fail, and it will with Obama and Harry in charge, they will get all the blame. Let the blame fall where it belongs. Let him carry out his ‘mandate’ and while we will all suffer, we won’t have to concern ourselves with Billary running, or Kerry. No intelligent Democrat will desire to inherit what Obama will leave behind. He will have indeed been successful in changing the greatest nation on the planet and should get the blame for it as well.

Because Ricky says it, doesn’t mean it is so. Because Limbaugh says it doesn’t necessarily mean it is wrong; it all correlates to Ricky’s oft-used example of the broken clock. Because a persons opinion or beliefs don’t correspond directly with another person’s simply means a difference of opinion.

No. That is specifically what is going on with SOME of those on the government dole. And I'd wager its not very many. Just like only SOME of those with large unearned incomes feel they are entitled to Romney's 0% tax rate. I imagine that is a minority as well. You use a few bad apples to spoil the whole bunch. That is class-based prejudice. "The recent election results are a prime example." The recent election results are a prime example of what happens when a party and a presidential candidate insults 47% of the population by assuming they are all freeloaders. Neither you nor Romney make any attempt to find out anything about the situations of those American's who did not pay income tax in one specific year. Do you know if they paid taxes the year before? The year after? No, you don't. I can tell you that in 2010, if I was not a member of the 47% I was pretty close. I worked all of 2010 but not for much money and I was able to claim some tax credits. But other than that I have worked and paid taxes every year of my life since I was 16. College students, people out of work, underemployed people, members of the military, who have or will contribute to this country throughout their lives, are just freeloaders to you. And to Romney. It is your class prejudice that cost Republicans the election. Keep it up. I don't care. Take it all the way to the next convention.
