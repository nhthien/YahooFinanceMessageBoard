Next up is the Medicine Cabinet Tax that took effect in 2011. This tax prohibits reimbursement of expenses for over-the-counter medicine, with the lone exception of insulin, from an employee’s pre-tax dollar funded Health Saving Account (HSA), Flexible Spending Account (FSA) or Health Reimbursement Account (HRA). This provision hurts middle class earners particularly hard since they earn enough to actually pay federal taxes, but not enough to make this restriction negligible. The Flexible Spending Account (FSA) Cap, which will begin in 2013, is perhaps the most hurtful provision to the middle class. This part of the law imposes a cap of $2,500 per year (which is now unlimited) on the amount of pre-tax dollars that could be deposited into these accounts. Why is this particularly hurtful to the middle class? It is because funds in these accounts may be used to pay for special needs education for special needs children in the United States. Tuition rates for this type of special education can easily exceed $14,000 per year and the use of pre-tax dollars has helped many middle income families. Another direct hit to the middle class is the Medical Itemized Deduction Hurdle which is currently 7.5% of adjusted gross income. This is the hurdle that must be met before medical expenses over that hurdle can be taken as a deduction on federal income taxes. Obamacare raises this hurdle to 10% of adjusted gross. The fifth new tax on the middle class, and all Americans, is the Health Savings Account (HSA) Withdrawal Tax Hike. Another regressive tax that is part of this law began in 2010 and that is the Indoor Tanning Services Tax, which places a 10% excise tax on people using tanning salons. The seventh new tax that directly impacts the middle class, along with all citizens, is the Excise Tax on Comprehensive Health Insurance Plans. 20 million Americans will lose their employee funded health insurance as a result of Obamacfare. Another new tax, the Tax on Medical Device Manufacturers that begins in 2013, places a 2.3% excise tax on all items retailing for more than $100. This provision will not only drive up the cost of various medical devices ranging from mobility assistance devices to personal testing supplies, but will also impact an industry that employs 360,000 people in 6,000 plants across our country. This tax, while not a direct tax, would have significant negative impact on the middle class.</Msg><Username>ricky1820l</Username><Timestamp>1351438901009</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 11:41:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351439768782-17</Id><Topic><Title>ATT retiree benefits</Title><Username>splicerwannabe</Username><Timestamp>1343908864000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-02 08:01:04 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let them know your concerns.

Do not "ask" for Enrollment, nor Healthcare, but go to "Adoption", or anything other than those two options. Ask your question and you will likely get a more accurate option--at least they will be more co-operative.I have been calling since August and got a couple knowledgeable people, but since Enrollment has begun, they put the "gumchewers", (Bubble Gum I think), on line. They don't have a clue what you want, or they're just plain bored--for sure, they're not worried about their jobs.----------So glad I started calling in August and got some basic information that was accurate.I finally got to talk to a lovely girl named Nicole in Orlando,Florida.....she said I could ask for her again.......haven't tried back.Nicole was actually be my 12th person to talk to, if you count the August calls.She gave me an alternative way to go about this that was actually designed for someone in the situation of my husband and myself. It's good in my opinion.This is our situation: ATT REQUIRES retiree to accept Medicare PARTS A and B. This will happen automatically and you are not to try and cut it out because they will cut you off!!!!! Husband retired and hits Medicare at 65 next month. SS check will deduct $99.00 from his check. State Street, T's financial folks, will put back in $49.00 at end of month. Healthcare goes from $19.67 per month for the both of us for Healthcare, to 11.67 per month for Nov and Dec. NOW January,2013, new ballgame. Husband's deduction is $0 (except for the $1 for Careplus), but MINE goes to $146.00. I will not go into further details......but the end result is that my final deduction will be $0, except for the $1 for Careplus. How? Clic on Enroll, when you see the options, click on CUSTOMCARE NETWORK ALTERNATIVE PLAN.............This was the plan that was intended for those like me. The only difference in the original plan and this new plan is this: $500.00 DEDUCTIBLE if you are checked into the hospital, and THE COMPANY PAYS 80% of the hospital bill, you pay 20%. The new prescription plan is the same except the deductible for family is $225.00, and if you check other big copays if you go to the emergency room......all of that is the same for both of us......but going up.Stay out of the hospital, and Silverscripts(UHC's version of prescription drugs), rolls over automatically. By the way, Silverscripts folks know a lot.......if you're beginning Medicare, call them, they're nice and helpful.I will stil be on Careplus and he will be rolled over into Silverscripts. At beginning of year, a new method will be given to you. Don't call careplus because they don't seem to know anything, but Silverscripts is the same, but handling medicare, but very knowledgeable. Hope this helps somebody. I've tried to verify that what I've put in is accurate, and will spend time on the phone tomorrow, but as far as I know, I've got it all straight. Won't be comfortable until I call back and confirm what I think I know. Hope this is helpful.</Msg><Username>windyfrostt</Username><Timestamp>1351472730322</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 21:05:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351474610164-46</Id><Topic><Title>Romney wins</Title><Username>freakedout35</Username><Timestamp>1351454377244</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 15:59:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>absolutely marvelous spot on post ---peppeek</Msg><Username>m.swanger</Username><Timestamp>1351474610164</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 21:36:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351475213799-47</Id><Topic><Title>Romney wins</Title><Username>freakedout35</Username><Timestamp>1351454377244</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 15:59:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So sad.
