It noted there are various forms of Malware out in the wild that Attack Android devices. Two forms of malware cited by the FBI IC3 are Loozfon, which Steals Information from Users, and FinFisher, which can give Nefarious Hackers control over a user's device. Loozfon can lure in Victims by promising users a work-at-home opportunity in exchange for sending out an e-mail. Visiting a link in the e-mail will push Loozfon to the user's device, Allowing the Malware to Steal contact details from the device's address book. The FinFisher spyware highlighted by the IC3 allows for a mobile device to be remotely controlled and monitored from anywhere. FinFisher is installed by simply visiting a Web link or opening a text message that Disguises itself as a system update. The Presence of Malware on Android Has Been Known For Some Time, while Apple's tightly controlled iOS platform is far less susceptible to malware." Ignore the FBI Warning at your own peril, boys. Android = Nefarious Hackers which Steal your information = Bad. Apple = Tightly controlled, far less susceptible iOS platform = iGood. Isn't that one of those oxymorons? An Android smartphone user?</Msg><Username>best.warning</Username><Timestamp>1350368774686</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 02:26:14 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350375900441-4</Id><Topic><Title>**** FBI Issues Warning Regarding Android Malware ****</Title><Username>best.warning</Username><Timestamp>1350368774686</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 02:26:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Your life is one big virus</Msg><Username>mikeywalson</Username><Timestamp>1350375900441</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 04:25:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350376913565-5</Id><Topic><Title>Galaxy S3 vs HTC One X+: What's The Best Andorid Smartphone?</Title><Username>findingnemoyes</Username><Timestamp>1350353463832</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2012-10-15 22:11:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Could verywell be a 2GHz version - recalled some hackers OCd to 1.7GHz and sure enough a 1.7GHz T3 turned up.

At the high-end, Microsoft will offer a 64GB Surface with a Touch Cover for $699. All of the models show October 26th as a shipping date. Microsoft also lists the Touch Cover separately for for $119, which features a flat touch keyboard, while the version with a more traditional keyboard costs $129. Pricing was one of the many key details Microsoft left out when it unveiled the Surface tablets in June, and I’m sure the company wanted to make a bigger deal of having an iPad competitive $499 price. You’ll be able to pre-order a Surface at Microsoft’s site starting at 9 am Pacific today, or you can pick one up at a Microsoft store on October 26. The Surface RT pricing is surprisingly level-headed for Microsoft, though a part of me wishes the company went the extra mile to price it below $499. Given that Microsoft is starving for tablet market share, it would have made sense to aim for a $399 or $450. Then again, given just how slick the Surface looks, Microsoft may already be losing money on the Surface RT’s $499 price. We’re still awaiting pricing on the slightly larger Microsoft Surface running Windows 8 Pro, which will be able to run existing Windows programs and sport more powerful hardware (at the cost of being heavier). Since that Surface is basically a full-fledged PC, it’s expected to sell for $800 to $1,000. Windows RT devices, including the Surface, will only be able to run new Windows 8 apps from Microsoft’s app store.</Msg><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1350405793276</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 12:43:13 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350407153079-25</Id><Title>"A few more sheep and we'll have a load, boys."</Title><Msg>Baaaaaaaah.</Msg><Username>bests_trucking</Username><Timestamp>1350407153079</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 13:05:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>10</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1350407324325-26</Id><Topic><Title>LIKE AN APPLE: MICROSOFT WILL DESIGN THEIR OWN ARM CHIP INTEL DOOMED</Title><Username>eastofeastside</Username><Timestamp>1350062580700</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-10-12 13:23:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>"If selling Tegra at scale actually hurts Nvidia's profitability" that is NOT a problem, T3 has enough gross manufacturing margins.

Intel CloverTrail Windows 8 enterprise tablets should also sell well. The bottom line is profits not gross margins and those will continue on an upward trend as Atom volume increases again from tablets and phones while Haswell and Server sales keep the gross margins up. Intel's gross margins increased when it stopped trying to kill AMD in price and marketshare wars but the extra marketshare it had then more than made the profits up. There is plenty of slack in Intel's pricing to take any ARM threat in its stride. In 2014 there will be 5W quad-issue eight-port dual-core with hyper-threading 14nm Broadwells facing the highest performance ARM quad-cores in the top tablets. It will be a bloody performance slaughter of the 20nm S4/A15 chips.</Msg><Username>marsavian</Username><Timestamp>1350411879444</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-10-16 14:24:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1350412621234-35</Id><Title>Marsavian hasn't changed much - always comparing Intel's futuristic products vs.t competition's current ones offrings</Title><Msg>or even last-gen products.
