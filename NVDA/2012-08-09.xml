"The U.S. trial that started last week has gone fairly well for Apple so far. While jury trials are always somewhat unpredictable, this is an exceptional case in which there appears to be overwhelming evidence in favor of one party: Apple. This impression is further strengthened by indications of unuual nervousness on the part of Samsung's legal team. Samsung's denial of copying now even makes it the laughing stock of TV comedians. Mashable published Conan O'Brien's denial-of-copying video, which features a fake Samsung executive and juxtaposes certain Apple and Samsung products, culminating in a picture of "Samsung founder Stefan Jobes". Considering that this is a serious business issue, a fight over potentially billions of dollars in damages and market share in a market measured in the hundreds of billions of dollars, it's quite unusual for a company's defense to be ridiculed on television. Samsung tries to deny the undeniable. It's all too obvious what Samsung has done. Among the evidence that Apple has put on the table so far, there were two items that I considered particularly impressive: 1. According to Apple's trial brief, Google warned Samsung that its products looked too similar to Apple's and that this would provoke litigation; and 2. In a 2010 internal report, Samsung compared the iPhone to its Galaxy phone and decided that the Galaxy would be more successful if it looked and operated more like the iPhone. Having looked at a certified translation of that Samsung document, I can't help but conclude that similarities between Samsung's subsequently-released smartphones and the iPhone were fully intended. At the more general level of whether Samsung deliberately copied Apple's designs and technologies, Samsung has strategically lost this case in all likelihood. Its claims of being merely an independent innovator and competitor have been reduced to absurdity by the evidence. It would take a reality distortion field of unseen proportions to convince anyone that Samsung created iPhone and iPad lookalikes by mere coincidence. The disaster that Samsung is heading for is an overall decision that will probably be quite consistent with Apple's allegation that Samsung copied Apple's products all the way, from packaging design to physical appearance to user interface elements to operating system architecture. This is not a criminal case, but the outcome may be the next best thing to a "guilty as charged" verdict. That would affect the way Samsung is perceived not only by the market but also by judges who will have to decide on various other infringement claims Apple has brought against Samsung in multiple jurisdictions. If Apple convinces the court that Samsung infringed its rights willfully, I don't think it will take too long before the next California trial over another set of intellectual property rights asserted by Apple. But sooner or later, Apple will have enforced enough intellectual property rights to have major leverage. Samsung made its bed and now has to lie in it. Samsung ignored Google's warnings, and determined that imitation, not independent creation, was the most promising way forward. It has stepped over the line. In the marketplace, that has paid off, but it's probably not going to be tolerated by the court. Apple hasn't won this yet. But a week and a half after the trial started, Apple undoubtedly has the upper hand." http://www.fosspatents.com/2012/08/samsung-can-hardly-explain-away-all-of.html It's looking like Apple might get that Samsung fab plant as settlement, right boys? -</Msg><Username>best.here</Username><Timestamp>1344485767000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 00:16:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344514510000-2</Id><Topic><Title>Samsung behaves badly in Court.</Title><Username>i_read_best</Username><Timestamp>1343968631000</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-03 00:37:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- Oh my!

Decided to ring the register as I was feeling a little apprehensive (and still do inspite of leaving a few cents on the table today as of this posting). Sometimes, it pays dividends to be a little apprehensive going into an NVDA Q report. That being said, GLTA whichever way she goes later today. And if I am correct in taking my short term profits, I will definitely re-enter when the dust settles.

I just bought in today at $14.36 and feel odds are good for solid NVDA earnings and outlook. I believe this to be a good entry point due to new innovative products ramping up, new focus on pursued markets, financial strength of company and, important to me, a prior quarter that was rough due to supply constraint issue. I always look for solid companies that are down due to issues that are out of their control. You're right if NVDA cc goes south, I will be with NVDA for quite a while longer until recovery comes around, but I'm ok with this; no borrowed money here.

You might consider buying a few calls going into earnings to participate in the upside without significant capital investment. I bought at $14 and immediately sold the Aug 10th $14 calls for .50. When NVDA held 14, I used those premiums to buy the Aug. 18th $15 calls to participate in the upside. Already in the green on the purchased calls, and can sell any time knowing my cost basis on the shares originally purchased is $13.50 after the covered call premiums. Safe way to play the earnings in my opinion.</Msg><Username>investandprosper</Username><Timestamp>1344535557000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 14:05:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344536336000-39</Id><Title>Earnings will be good...</Title><Msg>Look at that price action today.

Perhaps you would be better off by taking half the money off the table and let the rest ride the surging wave of the company forward.

The big guys have all taken their positions and now its time to ride it up for the big score. Once the retail investors get in late and at the top to push it even higher, they will start to sell for profit and it will settle down again. The traders are going to make a killing on this stock. They basically said, that their market share is only going to get better and the yields are getting better on 28nm which makes their margins go higher. This being the case, with an increase in revenue and higher margins, their earnings expansion can accelerate quickly. I think in the 15's, you are still looking at a 50% upside potential in 6 to 9 months. What are they going to do with all that cash?</Msg><Username>neo_trinity1020</Username><Timestamp>1344558528000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 20:28:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344562557000-210</Id><Title>Tablet Gaming Gone Wild</Title><Msg>All thanks to the Nvidia quad-core Tegra 3 http://www.forbes.com/sites/jasonevangelho/2012/08/09/nvidia-and-other-tech-powers-betting-on-tablet-gaming-revolution/?partner=yahootix Gaming Revolution is here.</Msg><Username>stock_revealer</Username><Timestamp>1344562557000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 21:35:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344563201000-211</Id><Topic><Title>Sideways Action Occurring</Title><Username>karolaufe132</Username><Timestamp>1344528905000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 12:15:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>HUGE RETURN TODAY!</Msg><Username>daltpzp468</Username><Timestamp>1344563201000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 21:46:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344566227000-212</Id><Title>F*K - they manipulated NVDA for so long!</Title><Msg>WTF as*les ... finally</Msg><Username>oih_2007</Username><Timestamp>1344566227000</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 22:37:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344566725000-213</Id><Title>Isee a new trading range 16.9 high, 14.80 low</Title><Msg>Good acting general market it may hit the upper limit.
