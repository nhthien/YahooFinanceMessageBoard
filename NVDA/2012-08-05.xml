IDC has now released its own estimates of tablet shipments for the quarter, and while the overall picture is very similar to Strategy Analytics' numbers with estimates of 25 million tablets shipped and a 68% share for Apple's iPad, IDC offers an interesting look at the competition by breaking things down by manufacturer instead of by platform. According to IDC, Samsung remains the number two tablet manufacturer behind Apple, but despite strong 117.6% year-over-year shipment growth still saw its tablets outsold by the iPad by a margin of 7-to-1. "Apple built upon its strong March iPad launch and ended the quarter with its Best-ever shipment total for the iPad, outrunning even the impressive shipment record it set in the fourth quarter of last year," said Tom Mainelli, research director, Mobile Connected Devices. "The vast majority of consumers continue to favor the iPad over competitors, and Apple is seeing increasingly strong interest in the device from vertical markets—especially education. Apple's 17 million iPad shipments were a new record for the company as it rides the momentum of the new third-generation iPad and its lowest entry-level pricing ever with the Wi-Fi iPad 2 continuing to be available at a lower price of just $399. With competitors launching smaller tablets that have enabled them to push tablet pricing down toward $199, Apple is reportedly looking to launch its own "iPad mini" later this year with an eye toward capturing that portion of the market as well." http://www.macrumors.com/2012/08/02/ipad-outnumbers-samsung-tablets-7-to-1-in-2q-2012-shipments/ Maybe you boys bought the wrong stock? -</Msg><Username>ibest.here</Username><Timestamp>1344141103000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 00:31:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>69</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344142162000-4</Id><Topic><Title>Nvidia Making Millions From Sale of Google's Nexus 7 Tablet</Title><Username>getanid61</Username><Timestamp>1344135251000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-08-04 22:54:11 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>- C O R R E C T I O N.

AMD’s latest quarterly report shows just how bad off the company is. Year-over-year revenue fell 10% to $1.4 billion. Non-GAAP net income fell from $70 million to $46 million. AMD was Intel Corp.’s (NASDAQ: INTC) most direct competitor five years ago, and held about 24% of the server and PC chip market in 2007. Last year, its market share fell to 19%. But that is not AMD’s single greatest problem. The company bought graphic chip maker ATI in 2006 for $5.4 billion. PC makers had begun to add more of these chips to their machines. AMD needed to keep pace with rival Intel and graphic chip maker Nvidia Corp. (NASDAQ: NVDA) The main result of the ATI transaction was that it saddled AMD with an unsustainable debt and did almost nothing to help AMD’s fortunes. AMD had revenue of $6 billion in 2007, while Intel’s was $38.3 billion. Last year, AMD’s revenue rose to only $6.6 billion, while Intel’s soared to $54 billion during the same period. AMD has had three CEOs in the last five years, as it struggled to find a strategy for growth. The company’s greatest challenge may lie ahead as much of the personal computing market moves to tablets and smartphones. The chip used in the Apple iPad was designed by Apple, and made by Samsung. The Apple iPhone 5 will probably be powered by a quad core processor made by Samsung, the same chip used in the Samsung Galaxy S III. The other primary designers of the current generation of chips are Qualcomm Inc. (NASDAQ: QCOM) and ARM Holdings PLC (NASDAQ: ARMH). AMD’s products are almost nowhere to be found in this latest generation of portable devices.</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1344196743000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 15:59:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344196775000-30</Id><Topic><Title>AMD will never recover</Title><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1344196743000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 15:59:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>http://247wallst.com/2012/08/01/nine-great-american-companies-which-will-never-recover/#ixzz22hgBE5Yz</Msg><Username>eir951</Username><Timestamp>1344196775000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 15:59:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344196817000-31</Id><Title>Food for thought....</Title><Msg>Where do most cyber attacks on U.S. Computers originate from ?

"The new iPad Mini tablet is expected to launch this fall for between $249 and $299", says the NYT. http://www.bgr.com/2012/07/16/ipad-mini-price-rumor-launch-nyt/ So that's what? A Genuine Apple iPad for a mere $50 bucks more than the Nexus 7. Which you can't buy even if you wanted to. Because of multiple defects and manufacturing problems. These Genuine iPad Mini's are gonna sell like Hotcakes! -</Msg><Username>fao.best</Username><Timestamp>1344198802000</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-08-05 16:33:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>47</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344200839000-34</Id><Title>NVIDIA's Google Nexus 7 win is a big deal (SeekingAlpha)</Title><Msg>http://seekingalpha.com/article/781781-nvidia-s-google-tablet-design-win-is-a-big-deal We think the author John Helzer is J7777 known by the Yahoo NVDA board.

That's what they show on the Nexus 7 Out-of-Stock Tracker. http://www.nowinstock.net/computers/tablets/asus/nexus7/ $249.00 And if the new Genuine Apple iPad Mini sells for $249.00 too, how will Google ever move those 3 million Nexus 7's -- that nobody wants?

Google screwing-up their own business model. By going into tablet devices. Google's original model was a good one, right? Charging advertisers $2 bucks a word for search words. Like "Restaurant" or "Cruise" or "Motorcar". Well, okay. Maybe "Motorcar" wasn't worth $2 bucks. But they made a Whole Lot of Money charging for words. All kinds of words. And then they screwed things up by thinking they could make tablets. And compete with Apple. HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA HA! Even Jen cuda told them they were dunder-heads.
