Who's holding the pitchfork? So I guess you missed all the comments about "teabaggers" and all those other sweet rants against conservatives, or are those acceptable to the low information crowd? You're holding the torch for a group that represents nothing good, except of course good intentions but coupled with bumbling ineptitude. That's quite a grandiose plan you've got. I hope it works for you. It won't and never has anywhere it's been tried, but don't let those sad facts stop you from being another useful idiot....</Msg><Username>anotherobamafailure</Username><Timestamp>1366086929727</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:35:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366087020548-2</Id><Topic><Title>Who voted democrat</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1365826740193</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-04-13 00:19:00 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I'm sorry, I guess I missed the part where you were busy "devaluing others" as you hypocritically pointed the finger everywhere but in the mirror.

The Tea Bagger sack suckers keep pounding on dead myths as if continuous repetition of their own lies might make them come true. Will they ever learn? The fools beat to death their "birther" issue until their hero Sheriff Joe nearly blew himself up opening his mail. Then there was Mitt doing double-takes during his deer-in-the-headlights double-take when Obama busted him for LYING. Did the Tea Baggers learn from that? Of course not. They just continued to make utter fools of themselves by repeating Mitt's stupid lies. The voters turned the liar Tea Baggers out, but did that stop the flow of Tea Bagger lies. Hell, no! The sack And, they lost! LMAO! So, then the sack suckers went on a rabid rant about Benghazi. And, the beat goes on. The Tea Bagger lies just keep spinning on and on. That is all the Tea Baggers have left. Their numbers are depleted. Their silly causes are lost. The best thing about the Tea Baggers is ... THEY ARE OVER !

Ericsson (ERIC) just announced they are paying Microsoft (MSFT) almost $200mm to acquire their Mediaroom multi-screen video software in order to increase their multi-screen video reach by 11mm pay-TV households to 16mm for a 25% multi-screen market share. CCUR's MediaHawk multi-screen video delivery platform is superior to Mediaroom and CCUR multi-screen deals already signed with the #1 largest cable TV companies in Germany, Japan, and the UK. CCUR's huge multi-screen clients have a total of 14.8 million subscribers, which will make CCUR #2 in this space behind ERIC. CCUR only has 8.72mm o/s and is trading for only $6.16 with a market cap of $53.715 million. CCUR has $24.6 million in cash, giving CCUR an enterprise value of only $29.115 million, which is less than half its annualized revenue of $66.4 million and only 3.5X its cash flow from operations over the last 3 quarters alone! CCUR's video business, which also has the #1 largest video-on-demand (VOD) market share with a global reach of 50mm households, is currently receiving zero value! CCUR spent $15 million to acquire their Media Data Intelligence (MDI) business, which tracks the viewing behavior of 35mm pay-TV subscribers for a 35% market share in its space. CCUR also owns a "real-time" high performance computer processor business that powers many simulator devices in the defense and aerospace industry. It has annualized revenue of $27.6 million with 4 of the top 5 defense contractors as clients. This business is most likely worth $25-$30 million by itself! CCUR's multi-screen video delivery business with $33.8 million in annualized revenue is currently receiving no value, when it could be worth anywhere from $50-$200 million! CCUR is very profitable with its EPS doubling the last two quarters straight! CCUR's dividend yield is a huge 3.9%, higher than all its competitors!</Msg><Username>bbajf591</Username><Timestamp>1366098821660</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 03:53:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366110446415-11</Id><Topic><Title>tererists are people too</Title><Username>barryfromthehood</Username><Timestamp>1366087170984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:39:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you really are an ignorant #$%$...learn to spell #$%$ moron</Msg><Username>mrggecko</Username><Timestamp>1366110446415</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 07:07:26 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366110927356-12</Id><Title>HUGE NEWS OUT ON (BCCI) REGISTERED IN 26 STATES</Title><Msg>YAHOO NEWS</Msg><Username>fkiesereda</Username><Timestamp>1366110927356</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 07:15:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366111898728-13</Id><Topic><Title>tererists are people too</Title><Username>barryfromthehood</Username><Timestamp>1366087170984</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 00:39:30 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you must be a moslem.</Msg><Username>falcon3456</Username><Timestamp>1366111898728</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 07:31:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366113738841-14</Id><Topic><Title>The Tea Party is the best thing that has happened to America if 50 years.</Title><Username>king1mrchess</Username><Timestamp>1365746943613</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2013-04-12 02:09:03 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>hollow can we just talk about BAC.. we will always have wht blk grn brown blk yellow beige purple rainbow ,,, some will get along some will not some will win some will lose some were born to sign the blues movie never ends it goes on and on and on and on everybody wants a thrill paying anything to roll the dice just one more time so buy BAC now it will report a good one much better then C GS. place ur bet..</Msg><Username>rbrthng</Username><Timestamp>1366113738841</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 08:02:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366115408410-15</Id><Title>So far bank earnings have been good BAC wed am back to new highs soon</Title><Msg>BAC going to new highs soon! $16-$18 by year end Wish would go as fast as blackberry took less then a month I'm gonna be patient I hear this stock could double or Triple in next 2-3 yrs</Msg><Username>mistermotox74</Username><Timestamp>1366115408410</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 08:30:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366116958423-16</Id><Title>HOME RUN!

If you put one dollar a day in an account - that would equate to $6,000 in an account drawing 6%. Banks are not paying 6%, therefore you would need to find someone who is, and that would be corporate bonds. You would want to buy corporate bonds which are paying that type of interests. I have bonds that I bought at $560 per bond a few years ago with a face value of $1000 drawing 6.22% on the $1000 which equates to about 9.70% on my original investment. When they pay off the bonds, I get the $1000 which is a 44% return on investment. That purchase alone pays me $4.09 a day. I have some bank corporate bonds paying over 8% which are tied to the PS. The bonds I own range from 3.5% to 8.25% and a number of them are step-up meaning they will increase in percentage over time if not paid off. My 3% stock holdings are there for tax purposes only. I am hoping they will cover most of the income taxes when I start pulling my IRA. My BAC stocks were purchased at $6.28 a share and will wait for $38 however long it takes.</Msg><Username>m.inally</Username><Timestamp>1366130290580</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:38:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366130736485-52</Id><Topic><Title>The Tea Party, known as the low point in American political history, will soon be OVER !</Title><Username>kra88zee</Username><Timestamp>1365722599931</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-11 19:23:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>was rick santelli in Boston yesterday?</Msg><Username>orlsdad</Username><Timestamp>1366130736485</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:45:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366130977383-53</Id><Topic><Title>$13 Tomorrow</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1366126643326</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 11:37:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>In the very least better break $13 tomorrow $15 would be nice but a huge stretch.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1366130977383</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:49:37 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366131150719-54</Id><Title>Earnings Whisper $0.26 vs Consensus Estimate $0.23 ==== going higher $13+</Title><Msg>Watch for the takeoff as time approaches to 4pm</Msg><Username>styuiksv</Username><Timestamp>1366131150719</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 12:52:30 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366132660301-55</Id><Title>Everybody panic yesterday and today international $$$</Title><Msg>came and got everything at discount</Msg><Username>jgiled</Username><Timestamp>1366132660301</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 13:17:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366132926273-56</Id><Title>Bullish Three Inside UP pattern is forming ------ BAC's going higher, hold on to your shares.</Title><Msg>The Bullish Three Inside Up Pattern is another name for the Confirmed Bullish Harami Pattern.

Recognition Criteria: 1. Market is characterized by downtrend. 2. We see a Bullish Harami Pattern in the first two days. 3. Then we see a white candlestick on the third day with a higher close than the second day. Explanation: The first two days of this pattern is simply the Bullish Harami Pattern, and the third day confirms the reversal suggested by the Bullish Harami Pattern, since it is a white candlestick closing with a new high for the last three days. Important Factors: The reliability of this pattern is very high, but still a confirmation in the form of a white candlestick with a higher close or a gap-up is suggested.</Msg><Username>hrubil_2000</Username><Timestamp>1366133219033</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 13:26:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366133301572-58</Id><Title>Going to Flush this Turd</Title><Msg>Headed South again.</Msg><Username>telezz121</Username><Timestamp>1366133301572</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-04-16 13:28:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366133674419-59</Id><Title>Cnbc boiler room carnival barkers hyped GOLD last year straight</Title><Msg>Now all playing dumb hillarious paid GS shills they are criminal at best where's the FBI?

He's suffering from delusions of grandeur, wishing he was a Republican but unable to work 2 consecutive days in the same job. Next check comes on the 3rd, and he can go buy some liquor and smokes after he trades the balance on his EBT card. Then he'll be all better for a few days, too wasted to get on the bus to go to the library to use the free computer. After the money and booze is gone, all he's got is dreams of what he wants to be someday. Before this thought is banished to Siberia, I wonder if he would have to bend over to "completely take in the store", or would it just be shoved with some serious force, or would force even be necessary at all.
