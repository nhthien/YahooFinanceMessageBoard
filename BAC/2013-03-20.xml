Fannie Mae (FNMA.OB) and Freddie Mac (FMCC.OB) were seized by the government at the height of the financial crisis in 2008 as mortgage losses threatened their solvency. Since then, they have drawn about $188 billion in taxpayer funds to stay afloat, while paying about $58 billion to the Treasury in dividends. The two companies have now returned to profitability, and under the new terms, their earnings are swept into the Treasury as a dividend payment for the government's stake in the firms. If they are not profitable, no sweep is made. Previously, the companies, which buy mortgages from lenders and repackage them as securities for investors, were required to make a 10 percent dividend payment even if they had a loss. At times, they had to borrow from the Treasury just to make the payment. Now, they simply will not be able to retain any profits. "Ending the circularity of draws from Treasury to pay dividends will prevent the erosion of Treasury's commitment level," the Federal Housing Finance Agency's Inspector General said in a report. "The change in the dividend structure also will affect quarterly payments to Treasury, potentially resulting in the enterprises returning more money to federal taxpayers sooner."</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1363769775136</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 04:56:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363770727834-17</Id><Topic><Title>Bac up up and away over this next decade.</Title><Username>alex1611761</Username><Timestamp>1363754479912</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 00:41:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Finally an intelligent thread. Yes my calculations also show BAC to $50 in 5 - 7 years. But the quick move will be to $30 by Dec/2014. Any normalized eps or book value calculation shows this going to $30 fast. What I find interesting is what the CEO, Brian, has said. He basically wants to return to an older number of shares outstanding before the shares were diluted with the purchase of CW and Merryl Lunch. That probably means huge share buybacks for 2 - 3 more years (it will not take us back to a much smaller share count but get us closer). Merryl Lynch alone is said to make $10 billion a year and much more doing better times and we did not even own it when our firm was worth $50 in 2007. The costs of CW will last mainly through 2013 then it will be non existent. Mobile banking, world wide banking, a normalized Growing real estate market, investment banking, and Dodd frank law limiting competition will all make BAC bigger than ever. $30 soon, $50 long term.</Msg><Username>nasa_rs</Username><Timestamp>1363770727834</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 05:12:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363771513323-18</Id><Topic><Title>Tomorrow $13</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1363731807683</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-03-19 18:23:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I too expect $14 right after earnings on April 17th.

Not Bad!</Msg><Username>bluhorseshuluvsnfi</Username><Timestamp>1363785473306</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:17:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363785780159-39</Id><Title>Prediction</Title><Msg>BAC will be $14.50 by April 10, 2013.

The knock-on effect will mean pain for the business sector, with corporate profits falling after a hit to consumer spending power, the firm said. "Our view that unemployment could rise above 8 percent and that profits will be squeezed reflects a forecast of nil to negative 2013 (first quarter) growth, and further stagnation in (the second quarter)," a Lombard Street report released on Friday said. The view contrasts sharply with that of other analysts who are considerably more bullish on the U.S. economy. Keith McCullough, CEO of Hedgeye Risk Management told CNBC last week that he thinks employment could actually improve below 7 percent by the fourth quarter, adding that from a housing and employment perspective U.S growth is "pretty solid". Lombard Street does not agree. At the start of the year, the payroll tax that funds Social Security was raised two percentage points to its 2010 level of 6.2 percent. This was the largest component of tax increases approved by Congress in the resolution to the "fiscal cliff". Retail sales rose 0.1 percent in January, data released by the Commerce Department showed on Wednesday. These two events together should set alarms bells ringing as tax increases suggest a slowdown in the pace of consumer spending, Lombard Street said. "Retail sales data encouraged the idea that the payroll tax hike from 4.2 percent to 6.2 percent, worth 1 percent of personal disposable incomes, would pass off with little impact. But the effect of the payroll tax was only partly in January," it said, indicating that only a modest impact would have been expected for January. Monetary easing by the Federal Reserve provides few offsets to this drop in demand outside of the housing sector, according to Lombard Street. "The contribution of housing growth to GDP (gross domestic product) has been about 0.4 percent and promises to continue; that of government spending has averaged -0.4 percent for the past three years, and could easily exceed this in (the first and second quarter)," it said. This -0.4 percent contribution that the research firm cite is set to be complicated further with extra spending cuts after the "fiscal cliff" resolution and the sequestration - a deadline for automatic government spending cuts - due to kick in on March 1. "Our assumption is that the sequestration is canceled in favor of further cuts in a new provision. But this means the contribution from public spending to GDP growth could well be more negative than the past -0.4 percent," Lombard said. "In February the full effect of the payroll tax hike will be reflected in disposable income, and the initial savings "cushion" is likely to give way, so real consumer spending could be down." This real consumer spending could be down by more than 2 percent (annualized), it said, with little recovery in March. Thus for the first quarter a dip of 1.5 percent on an annual rate should be expected, contributing -0.1 to GDP growth. Inventory building and capital expenditure could prove positive factors on that figure, hence its forecasts that GDP could be flat to slightly down for the first quarter and remain stagnant for the second quarter. Along with the last quarter being negative, three straight quarters of zero growth will lead to a rise in the unemployment rate, the firm said. "Given underlying labor force growth of about 1 percent, this would add 0.7-0.8 percent to the unemployment rate, which was 7.9 percent in January. Even a less pessimistic view of (first quarter) and (second quarter) would send unemployment over 8 percent," it said. The chief risk to the stock market is that a reduction of the budget deficit is likely to be offset largely by cuts in the business sector's surplus, Lombard said, meaning a hit to corporate profits. However, this might be considered to be a contrarian view with some seeing U.S. growth stabilizing in 2013. Fed chief Bernanke has previously said that interest rates will be kept low until the unemployment rate reaches 6.5 percent. At the current rate of 150,000 jobs created every month, and 110,000 new entrants to the labor force, that will be around January 2017.</Msg><Username>fairvalue23</Username><Timestamp>1363800865581</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 13:34:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363800888908-132</Id><Title>California’s top earners are now facing a combined 51.9 percent federal and state income tax Two-Tax Rise Tests Wealthy in California</Title><Msg>California’s top earners are now facing a combined 51.9 percent federal and state income tax — the highest rate in the nation — a cause for grumbling and, maybe, an incentive to move.

Gross domestic product fell 0.6 percent in the fourth quarter from the previous three months, the European Union’s statistics office in Luxembourg said today. That’s the most since the first quarter of 2009 in the aftermath of the collapse of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. and exceeded the 0.4 percent median forecast of economists in a Bloomberg survey. The data capped a morning of releases showing that the economies of Germany, France and Italy all shrank more than forecast in the fourth quarter. European Central Bank President Mario Draghi said last week that confidence in the 17-nation bloc has stabilized and the ECB sees a gradual recovery beginning later this year, though the situation is “fragile.” “The outlook for 2013 remains subdued,” said Peter Vanden Houte, an economist at ING Group NV in Brussels. “While a gradual improvement of the world economy is likely to support European exports, domestic demand is bound to remain very weak as fiscal tightening and rising unemployment will take their toll on household consumption.” The euro extended its decline against the dollar after the data were released. It fell 0.9 percent to $1.3328 as of 10:34 a.m. London time. The single currency also weakened versus the pound and the yen. European stocks erased gains, U.S. equity- index futures fell, and German bunds advanced. Japanese Surprise The European data chimed with statistics in Japan, where the economy unexpectedly shrank last quarter as falling exports and a business investment slump outweighed improved consumption. GDP fell an annualized 0.4 percent, following a 3.8 percent fall in the previous quarter.

IceT moved in with Howard Hughes grandmother.</Msg><Username>vieweroutrage</Username><Timestamp>1363831018062</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 21:56:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363831294405-222</Id><Topic><Title>Buyback breakdown</Title><Username>bluhorseshuluvsnfi</Username><Timestamp>1363785473306</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:17:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So prepare for the Kondratief Winter!

This vast wealth, that is flowing into D.C., is a sign of the highest order of elitist apocrasy against the lower castes in America! A building boom is going on in D.C. and it's surroundings like Georgetown and other suburbs. This is at the expense of cities like Detroit, Chicago and Atlanta, just to name a few. Political elitists and the aids that they bring with them to Washington are thriving in a busted economy that in many ways resembles the decline of the Roman Empire!</Msg><Username>sdmiller4747</Username><Timestamp>1363832463176</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:21:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>6</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>4</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363833929647-226</Id><Topic><Title>Buyback breakdown</Title><Username>bluhorseshuluvsnfi</Username><Timestamp>1363785473306</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 09:17:53 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>a 2 for 1 reverse split will get your share count down quicker than an imaginary 16 yr buyback</Msg><Username>firstnamelastname501</Username><Timestamp>1363833929647</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-03-20 22:45:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1363834950240-227</Id><Title>.05-.10 cents a day is all i need</Title><Msg>Just keep moving up.
