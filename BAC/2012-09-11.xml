The institutions are buying. and Thompson our CFO is talking Bank of America is ready to get back to its core business of lending money, Chief Financial Officer Bruce Thompson said Monday at an investor conference. Thompson said the company is mostly finished in selling off non-core assets. The Charlotte-based bank for more than two years has been selling fringe units, everything from insurance arms to credit-card portfolios. Now the bank feels it has cleaned up its business mix enough to put more emphasis on loan growth. Thompson said loans to mid-sized businesses are especially attractive. "We are pressing hard there," he said at the Barclays conference, according to Reuters. BofA has trailed other megabanks such as Wells Fargo and JPMorgan Chase in loan growth in recent quarters. BofA also is in the middle of a multi-year plan to cut $8 billion in annual expenses. Thompson said a second phase of that initiative, known as Project New BAC, resulted in more than 1,500 suggestions of ways to streamline the company. He said the cost-cutting and divestitures were all designed to make BofA easier to manage and more suited to the needs of its customers.</Msg><Username>rocketscienc</Username><Timestamp>1347374442296</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 10:40:42 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347374757850-59</Id><Title>Big earning report this Friday!

And that's how it started.</Msg><Username>muchomacho42</Username><Timestamp>1347378560291</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:49:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347378631225-82</Id><Title>Green Mountain soared - JVA coffee about to soar on high volume.</Title><Msg>Plus they are a bit less risky than the banks:)</Msg><Username>hatepolitics101</Username><Timestamp>1347378631225</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:50:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347378681238-83</Id><Topic><Title>LOWER HIGHS LOWER LOWS</Title><Username>sargntshort</Username><Timestamp>1347378306744</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:45:06 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you got it wrong!</Msg><Username>rocketscienc</Username><Timestamp>1347378681238</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:51:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347379047142-84</Id><Title>The US$ print machine will never stops printing</Title><Msg>QE3...................QU100</Msg><Username>hbarackdolf</Username><Timestamp>1347379047142</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:57:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1347379198513-85</Id><Title>HEY TRADERX</Title><Msg>You're still a dope</Msg><Username>tradejunky</Username><Timestamp>1347379198513</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 11:59:58 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1347379333301-86</Id><Topic><Title>A black kid asks his mom, "Mama, what's democracy?"</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1347369767094</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2012-09-11 09:22:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Four of the five states with the least difference between black and white unemployment rates have deomcrat governors.

The worst two states to expect to get a job as a black in the US are the Dakotas followed by Mississippi, Minnesota, and Wisconsin..

Since then we saw $8.92 yesterday prior to Mr. Thompson's delivery investor conference update on BAC. Really, it is much better to be a great CFO than be the world's best speech deliverer. I thought he was pounced upon by the hedge funds yesterday with the intraday tanking of BAC share price to 8.53 after the delivery. So, with BAC now knocking on $8.85, I feel like getting out from under the rock I crawled under yesterday. Let's hope I don't get shelled later this afternoon by hedge fund dumping of BAC shares. I really appreciate Mr. Thompson's efforts. Good old fashioned banking is where BAC has been trying to get back to; and, I think they are succeeding in that effort.

The stock is just starting to rally and with a 3 million share float $15 soon is just around the corner (see chart). That would make it a 12 forward PE which is conservative for a company expecting to deliver $1/share net income and grow revenues 40% in 2013.........still very cheap even at $15 Facts? - Surging demand for its core license-based products - The company's cloud divisions are starting to show significant growth as well. The company's Cloud division Vroozi is growing exponentially as it's revenues exploded in 4Q just reported with 11 Fortune 500 customers already - NTWK just announced another North America cloud business unit. - Larger companies are swallowing fast growing enterprise cloud providers with SAP and ORCL certification and compatibility. The company has guided for up to 30 - 40% revenue growth in 2013 and $1/share net income. In last week's CC they also mentioned that they expect revenues to double/triple from $38 million to $75 - $100 million in revenues.

The conference call yesterday was actually positive, but you have to listen twice to see how careful he is. It came off as negative at first because he was being SO careful not to give forward guidance. But that is because it was actually wildly positive. Have to listen close. We are going to test $10 it is inevitable at this point. I think we may get some gyrations around there. Then earnings. And the elephant in the room is a Fannie Mae settlement.

Since the Sept. 11, 2001, terrorist attacks, U.S. policy has focused on al-Qaida and its offshoots. "They are more shooters than thinkers … it's a lot of muscles, courage, desire but not a lot of training," the agent said, referring to al-Qaida. Hezbollah, he said, is far more advanced. "Their operators are far more skilled … they are the equals of Russians, Chinese or Cubans," he said. "I consider Hezbollah much more dangerous in that sense because of strategic thinking; they think more long-term." Hezbolah has operated in South America for decades and then Central America, along with their sometime rival, sometime ally Hamas. Now, the group is blending into Shi'a Muslim communities in Mexico, including Tijuana. Other pockets along the U.S.-Mexico border region remain largely unidentified as U.S. intelligence agencies are focused on the drug trade. "They have had clandestine training in how to live in foreign hostile territories," the agent said. The agent, who has spent years deep undercover in Mexico, said Hezbollah is partnering with drug organizations, but which ones is not clear at this time. He told 10News the group receives cartel cash and protection in exchange for Hezbollah expertise. "From money laundering to firearms training and explosives training," the agent said. For example, he tracked, along with Mexican intelligence, two Hezbollah operatives in safe houses in Tijuana and Durango "I confirmed the participation of cartel members as well as other Hezbollah individuals living and operating out of there," he said. Tunnels the cartels have built that cross from Mexico into the U.S. have grown increasingly sophisticated. It is a learned skill, the agent said points to Hezbollah's involvement. "Where are the knowledgeable tunnel builders? Certainly in the Middle East," he said. Why have Americans not heard more about Hezbollah's activities happening so close to the border? "If they really wanted to start blowing stuff up, they could do it," the agent said. According to the agent, the organization sees the U.S. as their "cash cow," with illegal drug and immigration operations. Many senior Hezbollah leaders are wealthy businessmen, the agent said. "The money they are sending back to Lebanon is too important right now to jeopardize those operations," he said. The agent said the real concern is the group's long-term goal of radicalizing Muslim communities. "They're focusing on developing … infiltrating communities within North America," the agent told 10News." ...............................................................
