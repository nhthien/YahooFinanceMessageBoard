Specifically, it had Fed approval to redeem $5.5 billion of preferred shares along with approval to buy back $5 billion of common stock. The bank redeemed the preferred stock in May as part of a broader strategy of managing net interest margin by refinancing high-cost liabilities (with some of the redeemed shares paying over 8% in non-cumulative preferred dividend yield), and also in 2013Q2 repurchased $1 billion of common shares at an average price of $12.6. With tangible book value per share at $13.3, stock buyback was a good use of capital, and this remains true even at the current stock price of $14.1. CEO Brian Moynihan has commented: buying back common shares is the best way to continue to drive value for our shareholders and, indeed, the buyback has taken precedence over raising the dividend, which remains token at 1 cents/share per quarter. Mr. Moynihan went on to observe "we have more than adequate capital to support our strategic plans" and this appears to be true; at the end of 2013 Q2, the bank had top-tier common capital of $126 billion (calculated under the toughest standard of Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis) representing 9.6% of risk-weighted assets of $1,310 billion (calculated under the same regime). Given the minimum required ratio for 2019 is 9% (being a base minimum of 7.5% plus a systemically important financial institution or SIFI buffer of 1.5%), the present excess capital is over $8 billion.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1381121076227</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 00:44:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381122409107-8</Id><Topic><Title>This board is for BAC posting ONLY,</Title><Username>investor2210</Username><Timestamp>1381115437026</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 23:10:37 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Woah there cowboy!

What do you think the sequester did? Ok spend more money and get rid of the cheats. Now Entitlements are just what they say they are. They are not optional they are debts the government has incurred to the people. Quit throwing those silly tax numbers out. It is terrible that the bottom half of the public takes home so little of the gdp that they don't even earn enough to pay taxes. They wealthy if they get 90% of the income should pay 90% of the taxes and the amount the government takes should be increased so we don't have a deficit. You have had four years to study the ACA and no one has done squat so put in in effect, fund the government and then get to work on it. That is what the house should have been doing since the day it was proposed instead of trying to make Obama fail.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1381133466645</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 04:11:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381133589245-11</Id><Topic><Title>9 trillion 462 billion dollars</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1380955694704</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-10-05 02:48:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You should check and see how much has already been cut.

Censorship is all over this country, CNN works under censorship every day, just ask them why some thing are never put in their news casts? When most of the people distort the facts and sometimes outright lie on Fox, that is much worse than Censorship. After WWII our government made a study on Propaganda, they took a group of people and kept telling them "people with blue eyes" were evil and responsible for the bad things that happen in the world. It did not take long before everyone in the group believed those were facts, people with blue eyes were the one's responsible for all things bad in the world. Republicans made their biggest mistake when they Pledged Their Allegiance to Grover Norquist and not to this country, any terrorist can take over this country by doing that.</Msg><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381150622447</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 08:57:02 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>8</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381151180996-24</Id><Title>These alerts are boss</Title><Msg>I signed up for the free service and got some great tips.

This is the type of financial responsibility that I expect our leaders to follow. Credit is a tool not a bank account.

Specifically, it had Fed approval to redeem $5.5 billion of preferred shares along with approval to buy back $5 billion of common stock. The bank redeemed the preferred stock in May as part of a broader strategy of managing net interest margin by refinancing high-cost liabilities (with some of the redeemed shares paying over 8% in non-cumulative preferred dividend yield), and also in 2013Q2 repurchased $1 billion of common shares at an average price of $12.6. With tangible book value per share at $13.3, stock buyback was a good use of capital, and this remains true even at the current stock price of $14.1. CEO Brian Moynihan has commented: buying back common shares is the best way to continue to drive value for our shareholders and, indeed, the buyback has taken precedence over raising the dividend, which remains token at 1 cents/share per quarter. Mr. Moynihan went on to observe "we have more than adequate capital to support our strategic plans" and this appears to be true; at the end of 2013 Q2, the bank had top-tier common capital of $126 billion (calculated under the toughest standard of Basel 3 on a fully phased-in basis) representing 9.6% of risk-weighted assets of $1,310 billion (calculated under the same regime). Given the minimum required ratio for 2019 is 9% (being a base minimum of 7.5% plus a systemically important financial institution or SIFI buffer of 1.5%), the present excess capital is over $8 billion</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1381156298882</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:31:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381156339956-62</Id><Topic><Title>Obama's War on Banks</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1377567754094</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-08-26 21:42:34 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Z</Msg><Username>obamahusseinalen</Username><Timestamp>1381156339956</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:32:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381156369551-63</Id><Topic><Title>A Hotdog Vendor has more Business Experience than Obama</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1380734561139</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-10-02 13:22:41 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Z</Msg><Username>obamahusseinalen</Username><Timestamp>1381156369551</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:32:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381156380092-64</Id><Title>SELL EVERYTHING BUY FNMA FMCC ALERTS</Title><Msg>Explosive alerts be rich now</Msg><Username>karim12345</Username><Timestamp>1381156380092</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:33:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381156446138-65</Id><Topic><Title>Washington Redskins changing name to Benghazi Charade</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1381073005744</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-10-06 11:23:25 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Z</Msg><Username>obamahusseinalen</Username><Timestamp>1381156446138</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:34:06 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381156556984-66</Id><Topic><Title>bac should sue the government for discriminatio</Title><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1375838234488</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-08-06 21:17:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Z</Msg><Username>obamahusseinalen</Username><Timestamp>1381156556984</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:35:56 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381156614313-67</Id><Topic><Title>Will Obamacare pay for nasa_rss's lobotomy?</Title><Username>dumpo.bombie</Username><Timestamp>1381119160731</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 00:12:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Z</Msg><Username>obamahusseinalen</Username><Timestamp>1381156614313</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:36:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381156636651-68</Id><Topic><Title>The Tea Qaeda in congress holding US taxpayer's 401K's hostage !

A fanatic is one who doubles his efforts while losing sight of his purpose.</Msg><Username>jhitcher2011</Username><Timestamp>1381157729372</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:55:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381157855507-76</Id><Topic><Title>Remove These Terrorists, Rush Limbaugh, Fox and Grover Norquist, Save America</Title><Username>fireundersmoke</Username><Timestamp>1381146129291</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 07:42:09 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>how long will it be before libertlies calls you a racist for your remarks?</Msg><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381157855507</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:57:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381157934115-77</Id><Topic><Title>we can see from Masons postings that they have yet to remove that gerbil</Title><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381157267343</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:47:47 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>is that gerbi?l in danger of becoming impacted</Msg><Username>fevoter</Username><Timestamp>1381157934115</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 10:58:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381157935915-78</Id><Title>Obama: Amber Alerts are a NON-ESSENTIAL government function ....</Title><Msg>Shut 'em down!

They need a more dramatic crisis they can try and blame on the Republicans. The fact that Obama and the democrats have essentially gone unchecked in the media is always a very dangerous thing for a nation. One party should not be given a free pass. History shows us that people really suffer when this takes place and I'm afraid a debt crisis could be the catalyst to cause this to happen. Every president in history has had to negotiate with congress. The media should be asking why Obama is not willing to do this, essentially nullifying the role of congress and making the US into a dictatorship. Those are the questions and pressures that should be placed on Obama but they aren't happening. This is dangerous folks prepare accordingly</Msg><Username>eat_shit.pelosi</Username><Timestamp>1381158770711</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 11:12:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381158830809-86</Id><Topic><Title>2014: the year the voters cleanse the remnant of Tea Bagger brown stains from Congress.</Title><Username>j.farragut</Username><Timestamp>1380095114316</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-09-25 03:45:14 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Read a newspaper.

I am proud of President Obama, he can multitask better than any president before him, he will continue to put the people of the U.S., their rights before corporations. Pres.

What is happening is stagnation in the major indices. This happens when the large derivative players are shifting their positions. They are now moving money and are going to bet against both markets. In the past this is when large corrections take place (over 10 percent). The large derivative players are the ones that run the indices. For example look at Warren Buffet; he is a heavy derivative player that has, over the last five years, substantially decreased his position in stocks and gone the derivative route. Smart, rich player. Derivative are an easy way to hide money.......so large losses can be covered up. The SEC does not understand this and they cannot track this. The result is no regulation. It will only take one major, dishonest derivative player to send our financial systems into ruin.</Msg><Username>geraldmcginty2</Username><Timestamp>1381169710199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 14:15:10 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1381169722180-141</Id><Topic><Title>Two very large, dishonest derivative players will bring down the world financial markets</Title><Username>geraldmcginty2</Username><Timestamp>1381169710199</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 14:15:10 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Keep looking and connect the dots.

Satellite TV was supposedly discovered in 1990. 2. I bought a brand new 2006 Toyota Prius just before gas prices rose sharply and stayed at elevated levels. 3.

The GOP is never going to get the vote of the majority of independents because of their stance on other issues. those issues would include global warming. How can an entire party deny what the vast majority of climatologists around the world support? that is hard to understand especially while the same party has a significant segment that believes intelligent design is actually a valid theory. Fine if you want to believe the earth is 6,000 years old but don't ask me to have much faith in your other positions. Many in the GOP attempt to prevent the gay community from the same rights as other citizens. Many in the GOP have no actual plan for illegals. I guess they think of wee have enough security along the boarder, 12,000,000 illegals will go home. Evangelicals that prevent real candidates from getting past the primaries want to make sure Roe vs Wade is overturned. they may not even care that much about Obamacare but they sure want their religious beliefs to be forced upon me. I am not talking about propgamda. I am talking about the GOP platform - one t6hat will keep the GOP out of the WH for a long, long time. so maybe I am a "collaborator" of the left but that is because I have no other sane choice.</Msg><Username>annie3318</Username><Timestamp>1381179275411</Timestamp><DateTime>Mon, 2013-10-07 16:54:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1381180545016-188</Id><Title>Glad I got the F out last week at 14.05</Title><Msg>your dictator defacto "president" is ruining the market with his foolish decisions.
