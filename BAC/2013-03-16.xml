I drank snake wine and ate dog pho with my uncles (all Colonels) in their villa in Saigon. The only thing they wanted to talk about was sending money over to their Vietnamese brothers (all Colonels) in Westminster, Ca to invest in dental clinics, strip malls, pho restaurants and BAC. I told them to forget everything but BAC and Greyhound Racing. They said Greyhound racing could eventually be fruitful to the Pho Restaurants. I agree. BAC taking off faster than Greyhound chasing Rabbit around the track. Eventually the Greyhound get tired and ends up in the boiler at Pho Restaurant. The point is: Sell BAC at higher price than you bought it for.

If we all acknowledge that Bush's deficits were bad, then we have to acknowledge that the social entitlements are at the heart of it -- all Democrat ideas.

Brian did the absolute best thing to maximize long term shareholder value. By doing the $5.5 billion preferred stock buyback he is saving $450 million a year in interest expense, that will add a tremendous amount to the bottom line of net income. Also, the $5 billon common stock buyback is actually a huge bonus to the company. Remember the firm is selling for 60% of book value. That means, we are paying 60 cents for every $1 of assets. It is like saying we are buying $7 billion worth of stock ($5 billion plus 40% more which is $2 billion = $7 billion). What he has done is going to set BAC up for a great earnings run up for the 2nd quarter. Add to that, housing is quickly moving higher and higher and that means less foreclosures and more value for homes being sold, higher asset values on our balance sheet. We should hit $16 by Dec/2013.

So $15 looks more likely that $20. The cost cutting efforts would also add to margins. If they do more on cost savings, 2014 could be a real turn around year in terms of stock price and dividend increases. Buying now makes a lot of sense because economy improving, litigation cost will dissipate, losses from foreclosures disappearing, dividend increaes every year - all of these catalysts will take it to $20 and $25 in 2015. So 100% gain in two years is not a bad return.</Msg><Username>sm081969</Username><Timestamp>1363469514804</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:31:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363469640143-68</Id><Topic><Title>2013 EOY Price Target</Title><Username>workingtechie</Username><Timestamp>1363467747920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:02:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Now you know why WB invested BB$$s in this BAC..</Msg><Username>dell_stk</Username><Timestamp>1363469640143</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:34:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363470413035-69</Id><Topic><Title>'Organ trafficking': Rabbis arrested over massive crime ring</Title><Username>mel_gibson_2013</Username><Timestamp>1363469477987</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:31:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>old news die aszshole.</Msg><Username>goingupnow1</Username><Timestamp>1363470413035</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:46:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363470551602-70</Id><Topic><Title>2013 EOY Price Target</Title><Username>workingtechie</Username><Timestamp>1363467747920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:02:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Less not forget, Warren has 7% preferreds and those are probably next on the chopping block. That will save a small fortune too. No reason to believe that BAC cannot buy out Warren's preferred stock in late Summer. That will give a huge boost to cash flow generation every year. Buffett bought 50,000 preferred shares of Bank of America at a dividend of 6% a year, or $300 million dividend payment into Buffett’s pocket. Buffett also is receiving warrants that allow him to buy 700 million shares at a strike price of about $7.14 a share but those shares have always been calculated in the fully dilutted eps. That means, soon we could see $750 millon saving on dividend payments on the preferred stock. I definitely see $16 by Dec/2013, or higher.</Msg><Username>nasa_rss</Username><Timestamp>1363470551602</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:49:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363472317927-71</Id><Topic><Title>2013 EOY Price Target</Title><Username>workingtechie</Username><Timestamp>1363467747920</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2013-03-16 17:02:27 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I see some on CNBC call for a double in BAC from here...which is huge but in my mind seems reasonable. they have a lot of good things going for it.
