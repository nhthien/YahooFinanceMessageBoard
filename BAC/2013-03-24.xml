They cannot pay 60% of their earnings out in dividends at 64¢ a share, the Fed will not allow it. Net interest income is flat, Durbin limits the interchange banking revenue. BAC sold off profitable businesses in Britain and South America to simplify the company and satisfy regulators that their risk footprint was smaller. It is still going to take another couple of years to wind down the failing portfolio from Countrywide.

There is a world of difference in the banking industry between pre-crises and today. Your pre-crisis price was based on a housing bubble and ludicrous profits that were made on flimsy investment instruments which mostly went bad and, lo and behold, the financial system almost collapsed because of them. With a 10b+ share pool it is not returning to the level you quote. Not until the share pool is reduced to a decent level. It's simple mathematics. Why don't you discuss currently fundamentals and market conditions rather than what was? The world has changed.

It also had GOP’s Karl Rove, happy that the Senate passed a budget, because it might permit the “give and take’ of budget drafting that scholars like to cite. Donna Brazile seemed to echo the thought. Talking about gun legislation, Jim Messina, Democrat campaign leader, 2012, thinks 8-1 margin in favor of ‘background checks’ for gun buying is good news. Rove, though, feels some national registry of gun owners might be in the wings—terrible, terrible, even the thought!!! Ms Brazile admitted “there are not the votes” in the Senate for an assault gun ban. Talk of the GOP review/autopsy, etc. GOP admits the “image”—it is not “inclusive” and has many old men (white) for members. Rove trumpeted that GOP has 30 governors!!!, mentioned a few of the reactionary (ok, “conservative”) ones, also Senators Rubio and Cruz as bright lights for the yes “conservative” GOP. Argue, he said, that GOP is the party of “economic prosperity” and good things will occur. Peggy Noonan, eloquent always, and a WSJ writer, spoke of GOP internal battle—“debt reduction” vs “economic growth”. Brazile retort: GOP is against the majority of American people. Rand Paul, Senator, was quoted--::We cannot deport 12 million, oh, let the borders be made secure(r). Brief mention of Roe v Wade—Ms Noonan says, “let states decide it”…ditto the “marriage equality matter”. Justice ginsburg referenced, she said Roe v Wade was too sweeping. Obama in Israel, etc…showed Iran (nuclear weapon) of greater concern than Israel-Palestine issue, at least right now. Brief mention of resigned NJ governor McGreevey, touching upon redemption (his gayness, his distress passing prisons with many in them due to drug issues).

After thieving for years, not one of them has seen the inside of a prison. The phrase "I neither admit or deny the charges", became their way of escape.
