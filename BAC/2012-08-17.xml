But they do not repeat every word of it, they are paraphrasing (I know that is a long word for you but you can look it up) by using "You didn't build that" as a reference to the whole statement. Kinda like we refer to the constitution and people know what that is without having to state every word of it... go it? See how that works? It is pretty simple, really. Taken in its full context, it still goes down in history as one of the stupidest, most arrogant things a president has ever said, particularly in the CONTEXT of a horrible economy. What, you say you are insulted by me insulting your intelligence? Well, how does that feel, Einstein? You are as f*****g arrogant as Obama is.

Would you voluntarily pay more taxes if you could legally get away with paying less? It is a shame that someone who makes that much money pays such a low rate.... but blame the congress for making tax laws that allow it, dont blame the people who legally use it. Somebody approved the Code that allows Romney to pay that low rate, blame them. Our tax code is longer than Japan's and Great Britan's by multiples. Thousands and thousands of pages, and tons of gimees throughout. Thats what deserves the blame. Buffet pays a low rate too, and on income way higher than Romney. Is anyone saying that Buffet is a crook or unethical? He is making out billions better off than Romney. Romney is a drop in Buffets bucket.</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1345198401269</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 06:13:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345198536065-20</Id><Topic><Title>HOpe and Change Sucks !</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1345178592785</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 00:43:12 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I hope there is a change... in who lives in the white house...</Msg><Username>mrstan4089</Username><Timestamp>1345198536065</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 06:15:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345198613025-21</Id><Topic><Title>The relevant and unabridged text of Obama's 'You didn't build that' remark</Title><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1345144927442</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 15:22:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Washington Times soon to fall.

When people think with their gut and send their minds on vacation, bad things have a way of coming home to roost.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1345204875335</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:01:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345204928296-37</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo won't let me post any more</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1345176569901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 00:09:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Why post that you can't post when your post proves that you can post?</Msg><Username>shutter_islandward8</Username><Timestamp>1345204928296</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:02:08 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345205033079-38</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo won't let me post any more</Title><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1345176569901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 00:09:29 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Because if the king had a deck of 51, he'd think he was ready to play Double Pinochle.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1345205033079</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:03:53 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345205119814-39</Id><Topic><Title>Traderx ..FSLR rise up daily and BAC going to $8 not head to $4.40</Title><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1344526445755</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 11:34:05 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>you think I will beleive you. answer is no. your prediction on BAC from $5 to now most of them are wrong. and guess you already lost 80 percent of your money at FSLR. because you shorted at $15.15 , and FSLR bounced up so fast the next day , sure you don't have time to cover your shorted order. don't beleive you at all. you may still have $1600, not 1.6 mil</Msg><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1345205119814</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:05:19 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345205722049-40</Id><Topic><Title>The relevant and unabridged text of Obama's 'You didn't build that' remark</Title><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1345144927442</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-16 15:22:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>So now to take a few words out of context to distort the whole meaning should be acceptable? No you are wrong. A large portion do not know the whole statement or they would not be making such arrogant and sweeping statements about what was said. Such as "I built my house without government help" Or" I built my business by myself". What these statements show is that these people have become so dependent on government provided services that they no longer even recognize where they come from. They expect things like roads, safety, an educated work force, communications and international protection to be there magically as if laid down by some divine creator. Yes fish2kill is a lot smarter than you are, He at least knows that history will record the whole text of a statement and not attribute a few words taken out of context as the whole or as any kind of meaningful expression. He also recognizes that the extraction was made to serve only as misleading political jargon, just like the "I like to fire people" Romney quote. Also he doesn't plague the board using multiple IDs and pose as other posters that post here or did in the past "Mr. Stan".</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345205722049</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 08:15:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345207987064-41</Id><Title>Years from now historians will have forgotten the bushes</Title><Msg>Ignorance of the laws is no excuse.

If Romney's statement was a lie then The Obama campaign doesn't have to say a thing. On the other hand if what Romney says is true then it is only the PACs he has to contend with. I suspect the democrats know something is there. Romney sure makes it look that way. Why is it Romney couldn't even get his 2011 returns done on time or at lest in the period allowed by an extension? Ryan is already caught claiming he didn't ask for stimulus money when he did. For Romney to be found wrong about the taxes he paid would be the final nail in the coffin. 13% tax rate is bad enough when most tax payers compare it to what they paid.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1345212805349</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:13:25 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345212917198-146</Id><Title>Next resistence is at $8.14-$8.18 area eom</Title><Msg>But we could zoom through though.</Msg><Username>caplain_nobull1</Username><Timestamp>1345212917198</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:15:17 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345212978259-147</Id><Title>new yahoo message board</Title><Msg>how do you remove or put on ignore</Msg><Username>boredwithdarts</Username><Timestamp>1345212978259</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:16:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345213015901-148</Id><Topic><Title>Next resistence is at $8.14-$8.18 area eom</Title><Username>caplain_nobull1</Username><Timestamp>1345212917198</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:15:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>we are going to fly thru the 8s.</Msg><Username>rocketscienc</Username><Timestamp>1345213015901</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:16:55 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345213213377-149</Id><Topic><Title>If you are investing with out an advisor... not smart... get an advisor and start accounts for your kids...</Title><Username>williamknaub</Username><Timestamp>1345212541532</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 10:09:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Every successful individual knows that his or her achievement depends on a community of persons working together.

Though such a possibility exists... it is rare and happens very infrequently as it goes against the nature of the market itself most of the time and it happens very infrequently as the record shows. Most of the time these are rallies presenting opportunities for profit as the price charts indicate. I have profitted from such opportunities at least 4 times since the market bottom in March 2009 in the cycle. My last purchases are in July last month and my ave cost is $7.8 It is sad that a permabull, while always waiting for that big event to happen, often ends up becoming a bagholder. Permabears like Traderx is exactly the opposite and a loser. In my case being an informed realist being in control of my emotions... I will take profits following both the larger market (LMP Indicator) and the specific situation of bac. I am closely watching the action... as the LMP Indicator is pointing sill to a rise in the larger market in general in tandem with bac rise. But I'm not married to bac at all.

How, they will wonder, did a man so devoid of professional accomplishment beguile so many into thinking he could manage the world's largest economy, direct the world's most powerful military, execute the world's most consequential job? Imagine a future historian examining Obama's pre-presidential life: ushered into and through the Ivy League despite unremarkable grades and test scores along the way; a cushy non-job as a "community organizer"; a brief career as a state legislator devoid of legislative achievement (and in fact nearly devoid of his attention, so often did he vote "present"); and finally an unaccomplished single term in the United States Senate, the entirety of which was devoted to his presidential ambitions. He left no academic legacy in academia, authored no signature legislation as a legislator. And then there is the matter of his troubling associations: the white-hating, America-loathing preacher who for decades served as Obama's "spiritual mentor"; a real-life, actual terrorist who served as Obama's colleague and political sponsor. It is easy to imagine a future historian looking at it all and asking: how on Earth was such a man elected president? Not content to wait for history, the incomparable Norman Podhoretz addressed the question recently in the Wall Street Journal: To be sure, no white candidate who had close associations with an outspoken hater of America like Jeremiah Wright and an unrepentant terrorist like Bill Ayers, would have lasted a single day. But because Mr. Obama was black, and therefore entitled in the eyes of liberaldom to have hung out with protesters against various American injustices, even if they were a bit extreme, he was given a pass. Let that sink in: Obama was given a pass - held to a lower standard - because of the color of his skin. Podhoretz continues: And in any case, what did such ancient history matter when he was also so articulate and elegant and (as he himself had said) "non-threatening," all of which gave him a fighting chance to become the first black president and thereby to lay the curse of racism to rest? Podhoretz puts his finger, I think, on the animating pulse of the Obama phenomenon -affirmative action. Not in the legal sense, of course. But certainly in the motivating sentiment behind all affirmative action laws and regulations, which are designed primarily to make white people, and especially white liberals, feel good about themselves. Unfortunately, minorities often suffer so that whites can pat themselves on the back. Liberals routinely admit minorities to schools for which they are not qualified, yet take no responsibility for the inevitable poor performance and high drop-out rates which follow. Liberals don't care if these minority students fail; liberals aren't around to witness the emotional devastation and deflated self esteem resulting from the racist policy that is affirmative action. Yes, racist. Holding someone to a separate standard merely because of the color of his skin - that's affirmative action in a nutshell, and if that isn't racism, then nothing is. And that is what America did to Obama. True, Obama himself was never troubled by his lack of achievements, but why would he be? As many have noted, Obama was told he was good enough for Columbia despite undistinguished grades at Occidental; he was told he was good enough for the US Senate despite a mediocre record in Illinois; he was told he was good enough to be president despite no record at all in the Senate. All his life, every step of the way, Obama was told he was good enough for the next step, in spite of ample evidence to the contrary. What could this breed if not the sort of empty narcissism on display every time Obama speaks? In 2008, many who agreed that he lacked executive qualifications nonetheless raved about Obama's oratory skills, intellect, and cool character. Those people - conservatives included - ought now to be deeply embarrassed. The man thinks and speaks in the hoariest of cliches, and that's when he has his teleprompter in front of him; when the prompter is absent he can barely think or speak at all. Not one original idea has ever issued from his mouth – it's all warmed-over Marxism of the kind that has failed over and over again for 100 years. And what about his character? Obama is constantly blaming anything and everything else for his troubles. Bush did it; it was bad luck; I inherited this mess. It is embarrassing to see a president so willing to advertise his own powerlessness, so comfortable with his own incompetence. But really, what were we to expect? The man has never been responsible for anything, so how do we expect him to act responsibly? In short: our president is a small and small-minded man, with neither the temperament nor the intellect to handle his job. When you understand that, and only when you understand that, will the current erosion of liberty and prosperity make sense. It could not have gone otherwise with such a man in the Oval Office</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1345230751430</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:12:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345231081318-222</Id><Title>BUY NOW - GONNA DOUBLE BY THANKSGIVING</Title><Msg>load up - it's full steam ahead!</Msg><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1345231081318</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:18:01 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345231107348-223</Id><Title>oh mama you don't get it, the election is already over, Obama in for 4 more years !!!</Title><Msg>Get over it already !</Msg><Username>kds5862</Username><Timestamp>1345231107348</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:18:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345231389210-224</Id><Title>Where will BACclose today with Options expirations ?</Title><Msg>$8, Below $8 or Above $8 or where?</Msg><Username>mibudster</Username><Timestamp>1345231389210</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:23:09 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345231543653-225</Id><Title>Viagra needed</Title><Msg>Goes limp every day.</Msg><Username>johnnycashout26</Username><Timestamp>1345231543653</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:25:43 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1345231652318-226</Id><Title>under $7.75 should hurt the call</Title><Msg>but looks will not drop under $8</Msg><Username>station888canada</Username><Timestamp>1345231652318</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:27:32 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Strong Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345231717210-227</Id><Topic><Title>BUY NOW - GONNA DOUBLE BY THANKSGIVING</Title><Username>monett4</Username><Timestamp>1345231081318</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 15:18:01 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>could be before....at any rate BAC is a LIFE CHANGER at these prices...i'm thinking 30 and above during 2013.!

"I'm not one [of those] people who votes for something then writes to the government to ask them to send us money. I did not request any stimulus money," the congressman answered. But as we've now learned, Ryan did write letters. He did request stimulus funds." - Res ipsa loquitur, but ROTFLMAO waiting for flippant1 to deliver his euphemism for what everyone else calls "lying".</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1345241018975</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 18:03:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345242002087-255</Id><Topic><Title>Obama is destined to lose this election - here's why</Title><Username>bpr1205</Username><Timestamp>1345239684526</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 17:41:24 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>It isn't even Labor Day yet, and none of the big guns will come out until after the holiday.

News | The Ticket – 8 hrs ago The AARP plays a starring role in President Barack Obama's new ad defending his record on Medicare. But that doesn't mean the group has to like it. Hours after the Democrat's campaign released its new commercial, AARP Senior Vice President John Hishta bluntly denied any involvement in the ad and scolded Obama (as well as Republican challenger Mitt Romney). "The next president and Congress will decide the future of Medicare, and the candidates owe voters straight talk—not just 30-second ads—about what their plans will mean for today's seniors and future retirees," Hishta said in a statement. "We were not aware of nor have any involvement with this campaign ad. AARP is a nonpartisan organization and we do not endorse political candidates," Hishta said. "For the last 26 years, we've been providing voters with balanced information, without all the political jargon and spin, so they can make their own decisions on Election Day."</Msg><Username>value_investorr</Username><Timestamp>1345262000387</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-08-17 23:53:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>5</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1345262014628-324</Id><Topic><Title>Crazy Gay Activist and Obama supporter shoots up the Family Research Council.
