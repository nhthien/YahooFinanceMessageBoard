I got a feeling for much higher prices coming because the housing market finally is coming back strong. Example is people are bidding over the sales price as much in some cases $300,000 over the asking price in some areas of SV near San Jose. Also, new homes are being sold similar to during 2004 when people commute 1 to 2 hours away. This shows home prices in major cities are going up so people are buying farther away. This is sign of a normal or much better housing market. This is great news for world economy. This signals a world economic rebound not just in America because these type of activities is viral across the world as people start to see better times ahead. I think the whole world is now starting to scale upward starting this year 2013 and beyond. This is truly great news for everyone.</Msg><Username>buyornotto</Username><Timestamp>1363520424639</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 07:40:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363521935654-11</Id><Topic><Title>I love to see the right-wing piggy fools squeal and scream.

As a result, BAC announced a very large share repurchase plan of roughly $5 billion, and the redemption of $5.5 billion in preferred stock, in the months and quarters ahead. I saw no timetable for completion of the plans. This far exceeded the analysts' estimates of a $1 billion plan, and Wall Street cheered the moves with a 4% pop in the share price, up to about $12.60/share. Many investors are also cheering the move, as this will also mean that eventually the total share repurchase will keep the share price well under overall book value which stands today at only 63% of the share price. With an accelerated share repurchase, the number of shares bought back, at current pricing, would be roughly 400 million shares. Bank of America currently has about 10.8 billion shares outstanding. A total of 10.4 billion shares will still be outstanding, and the price to book value could dip at a bit under 60%. The shares would still be selling at roughly a 40% discount according to these metrics. That would place a fully valued price of about $18.00/share as the new foundation for analysts to view. Does this mean that BAC stock should be purchased at these levels? Well I suppose it would be how an investor views the recent developments." This is an excerpt from an article from seekingalpha. It is pure math and it makes sense.

At year-end 2012 for BAC the TBV was 13.36/sh. Still, stock can be bought at 6% discount from TBV and well worth it. Hard to see 18/sh on the stock with eps around 1.25 this year reflecting the pfds retirement and $5 billion buyback, There is also the uncertainty of legal matters and the possibility of under reserving for that.

Over the weekend, analysts warned the decision by the euro zone to force bank depositors in Cyprus to contribute towards a bailout—a first in the euro zone debt crisis—could hurt other peripheral nations, the euro and the global stock market rally. That warning appeared to be coming true as the euro edged lower at 1.2934 against the dollar, in early trade on Monday morning local time in New Zealand, the first global market to start trading. In his televised address, Anastasiades said he had to accept a tax on bank deposits in return for international aid, or else the island would have faced bankruptcy. "The solution we concluded upon is not what we wanted, but is the least painful under the circumstances," Anastasiades said. In that speech, Anastasiades urged lawmakers to approve the tax in a vote Monday. About 25 lawmakers from the communist-rooted AKEL party, the socialist EDEK and the Greens said they won't vote for the tax in the 56-seat Cypriot parliament amid deep resentment over a move some called disastrous. If Parliament rejects the tax, that would put the entire aid package in jeopardy. The vote was initially set for Sunday but was postponed until Monday—a national holiday in Cyprus.</Msg><Username>srbbs</Username><Timestamp>1363569501324</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 21:18:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>6</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363571090607-118</Id><Topic><Title>UGLY FUTURES!</Title><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1363558845813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 18:20:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fluckoff</Msg><Username>goingupnow1</Username><Timestamp>1363571090607</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 21:44:50 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1363571093260-119</Id><Topic><Title>UGLY FUTURES!</Title><Username>parisonr</Username><Timestamp>1363558845813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2013-03-17 18:20:45 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>toothpaste2013 , "....if Cyprus triggers runs on banks in other European countries, crushing their financial systems, those larger nations are more likely to be connected to the U.S. in terms of trade or something else.

Earn 3% Guaranteed</Title><Msg>Quietly, behind the scenes, the groundwork is being laid for federal government confiscation of tax-deferred retirement accounts such as 401k , IRAs. On Nov. 20, 2007, Theresa Ghilarducci, professor of economic policy analysis at the New School for Social Research in New York, presented a paper proposing that the feds eliminate the tax deferral for private retirement accounts, confiscate the balance of those accounts, give each worker a $600 annual "contribution," assess a mandatory savings tax on every worker and guarantee a 3 percent rate of return on the newly titled "Guaranteed Retirement Accounts," or GRAs. How would that be accomplished? The Carolina Journal reported Ghilarducci's 2008 testimony to Nancy Pelosi's House. Democrats in the U.S. House have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate workers' personal retirement accounts "including 401(k)s and IRAs" and convert them to accounts managed by the Social Security Administration. Your Government universal GRA investment savings account is an annuity managed by Social Security. Hedgecock noted '[m]ake no mistake here: Obama is after your retirement money. The "annuities" will "invest" not in the familiar packages of bond and stock mutual funds but in the Treasury debt!'
