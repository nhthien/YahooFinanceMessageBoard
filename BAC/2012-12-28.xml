I'm willing to bet the majority of the posters on this particular topic do not even invest, have 401's, 457's 403B's ( to make it simple, they are retirement accounts, something that over 50% of the evident voting majority do not have, or they would be genuinely concerned right now) Just to give you a math lesson........ without making it to complicated.. all liberals please ponder this..... actually I'll lay it out for you in simple terms that maybe you can understand.... but wait, first let me give you some background so you can understand where I'm coming from, I'll keep it short so you don't become distracted by a, oh, I don't know a bird or other animal who lands outside your window while you sit and surf the web or play halo while you wait for the post person to drop your social security disability check or unemployment check, or other entitlement in your mailbox. I paid for my own education, served in the military and worked protecting others for 27 years, I invested and invested all the while helping out a multitude of organizations, red cross, Untited Way ( by the WAY they ended up being a bunch of crooks run by Democrats) Boy and Girl Scouts, Salvation army etc...... I worked my fingers to the bone and all the while watched as criminals, no, not the Wall Street types, but the Burglars, Rapist, Thiefs , real racists and other types milked the system the entire way.... Now that all my hard work has finally paid off I'm being told that I have to "re-distribute" what I have worked so hard to earn. So, now to the math.... for those of you who have been able to read this far along wthout running to a re-run of Rosie or the View, or some other trash show saying the rich should pay more..... Are you ready.....How about asking for a flat tax for everyone if you are so willing to say those of us who pay the majority of taxes already should pay more do the if you can.... If a person makes 50.000 a year and pays a 10% tax,, how much would that be? Ok for the majority of you who posted, let me give you the answer it's $5,000, now lets say you make $100,000 a year with a 10% that would be,, ????? yeppers for those of you who had to get out the calculator it would be $10,000, so,,, don't you think it would be safe to say that those of us who make more already pay more taxes? if you answered no,,,please abstain from posting on this board... And Mr, Whizzard, please go back to OZ and stop thinking everything ( every study) you read on the internet is true, haven't you seen that commercial.... please let those of us who are tyring to make the money so we can support our families and unfortunately other families, and by the way,, ah, Mr Whizzard,,,,, the Myans were wrong, you might want to send back your end of the world/zombie survival kit,, as should the rest of the ignorant posters... please let the rest of us get back to supporting y'all until we can figre out what country you guys should be shipped back to,, I don't know,, maybe you should look back at the history of Argentina,,,think about it. and oh, side note, before any of you pick out any grammatical errors, usage etc,,,, in this post, this was a quick response, but it's also probably easier for you to read, so I left it as is, sorry, have to get back to history channel or Fox.</Msg><Username>educated.american</Username><Timestamp>1356671449146</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-12-28 00:10:49 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1356672067835-3</Id><Topic><Title>REID say were likey to go ver Fiscal Cl.......</Title><Username>rhinoinchgo</Username><Timestamp>1356637603980</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-12-27 14:46:43 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>There's no such a thing as cliff.

This is coming from a person who thought we should go clean up rat's nest in Afghanistan! Iraq was just a political grudge carried to an extreme! The problem is the crash of 2008 cause so much damage to the economy resulting in the FED monetizing the debt, inorder to keep the country out of a depression! The Republican's run from this fact. Healthcare especially supportive of the middle class will keep the country competitive. You can't run a country when all the worker bee's are sick or bankrupt from medical expenses. I thought we learn that lesson. Republican's think a market base healthcare system will keep costs contained....big laugh, the healthcare industry just passes the costs to the employers who now just pass the increases onto the worker bee's that are still fortunate enough to have a company plan!

A House version of the bill made it out of committee, but House leaders have yet to bring its version to the floor." Sound familar, the bill cannot get enough House Republicans to support it so it can come to a vote, sounds the same as last week’s Plan B vote, both situations probably due to an informal House Republican rule referred to as the Hastert Rule or if you prefer the "Majority of the Majority" rule. This House Republican rule makes passing a House Bill far more than simply getting a majority of House members to support a Bill. My understanding of the rule is that there are two versions the one Gingrich and Hastert used which required a majority of the Republicans in a Republican controlled House to support a bill before it can be brought to the floor for a vote and the one Boehner is known to have used which requires the number of House Republicans supporting a Bill be equal to the number of votes needed for a Bill to actually pass the full House, a far more restrictive version. This second version would allow for a minority of Republican House members to dictate which bills actually come up for a vote. The reason for the creation of the rule as I see it is to prevent a group of Republicans from getting together with a number of Democrats to pass a Bill with out the blessing of the Republican House caucas. Boehner and company ought to reflect on the merits of this rule when they read the Constitution on the 6th. "I never submitted the whole system of my opinions to the creed of any party of men whatever, in religion, in philosophy, in politics or in anything else, where I was capable of thinking for myself. Such an addiction is the last degradation of a free and moral agent. If I could not go to Heaven but with a party, I would not go there at all."

He is demanding $1.3 trillion in higher taxes on the wealthy over 10 years. Imagine he got it. We are adding nearly that much to the national debt every single year. Taxing the rich would not put even a minor dent in our debt. It would pay for less than three weeks of federal spending every year. The only way to pay for the current expansion of government is to raise taxes on the middle class. So let’s do it.
