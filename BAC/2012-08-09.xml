It began with the usual whining from one not-so-thoughtful conservative about his objection to any new taxes, and accusations that anyone who wants to increase taxes on the rich is bent on destroying jobs and the economy. I opined that defenders of trickle-down, no-taxes economics were either unable to recognize the ultra-rich as a tax on everyone else, or were simply behaving like ostriches. To reiterate: Anyone whose thinks that the hidden burden of carrying a giga-rich ruling class is not a tax should look to the citizens of France for a few trenchant history lessons to the contrary that might better illuminate their dim view [and grasp] of the issue. The difference is that even the illiterate rabble who carried out the French Revolution were able to recognize the royals and their cohorts as an unjust tax, whereas many of the contributors to this board seem unable or unwilling to do the same. This country has become so enamored of the chiseler, the con man, and the card sharp, we've granted them the status of kings and queens of the realm. They hold all the aces; nothing below a jack plays, and the best the rest of us jokers can hope for is to be included now and then in one of their Charity Night penny-ante games. All that remains is for the next round of fiat currency to bear a Mississippi steamboat on one side, the grinning visage of good-looking Bret Maverick on the other, and the motto "Shut up and deal!" The conservatives on this board seem quite enamored of Bret's style, and eager to emulate it here: make a flashy and noisy entry into the game; flash a few bills and slip a few cards into the deck, play a hand or two, and then move on to the next table hoping no one notices their slight-of-hand maneuver. Come back, you Baltic Smugglers; let's play a few hands! ROTFLMAO at people whining about the wrong taxes everywhere.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1344514235756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:10:35 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344514708591-12</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo's minders didn't like last night's discussion about the wealthiest 400 Americans</Title><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1344514235756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:10:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>" are you OFF your med's lately - talk about rattling - gheez "</Msg><Username>da23533</Username><Timestamp>1344514708591</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:18:28 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344515020266-13</Id><Topic><Title>SABRIENT RATES BANK OF AMERICA A STRONG BUY..THAT'S RIGHT..YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST</Title><Username>greatestideaman</Username><Timestamp>1344471711390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:21:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FINALLY!</Msg><Username>bry345</Username><Timestamp>1344515020266</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:23:40 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344515159495-14</Id><Topic><Title>SABRIENT RATES BANK OF AMERICA A STRONG BUY..THAT'S RIGHT..YOU HEARD IT HERE FIRST</Title><Username>greatestideaman</Username><Timestamp>1344471711390</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2012-08-08 20:21:51 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>many more are sure to follow as all the skeletons appear to have been set free</Msg><Username>hubertus88</Username><Timestamp>1344515159495</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:25:59 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344515214074-15</Id><Title>Sabient changes rating on BAC to strong buy</Title><Msg>many to follow</Msg><Username>hubertus88</Username><Timestamp>1344515214074</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:26:54 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1344515224356-16</Id><Topic><Title>Yahoo's minders didn't like last night's discussion about the wealthiest 400 Americans</Title><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1344514235756</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 08:10:35 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Never attack the message; just attack the messenger, right?

People at large hate the banks at this time. Being anti-bank is very popular and money from the banks to Romney campaigns is widely known. GOP can no more hide behind slogans and sloganeering like it has before thanks to speedy information and a timely informed voters.</Msg><Username>johnmjay</Username><Timestamp>1344533558969</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-08-09 13:32:38 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1344533618711-77</Id><Title>If Goldman Sachs has losing trades only 6 times, why would we put our money in the stock market?

Would Goldman Sachs lose more than 6 trades if the UNITED STATES brought back the multicent uptick rule? DUH DUH DUH, I WOULD CERTAINLY THINK SO!!!!! They will fight the resumption of the multicent uptick rule until their firm's last dying breath I bet!!!!! Do you think so BAC? You got out of proprietary trading, correct? Why would you not fight for resumption of the multicent uptick rule like the SEC of the 1930's brought back into existence and served well with many decades of FINANCIAL STABILITY FOR THE UNITED STATES!!!!!!
