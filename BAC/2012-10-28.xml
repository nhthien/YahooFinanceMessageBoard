Obama led Romney 50 percent to 46 percent among Ohio likely voters, according to a CNN/ORC poll conducted Oct. 23 through Oct. 25. That's close to where the candidates stood at the beginning of the month. Among independent voters, Obama led 49 percent to Romney's 44 percent. The CNN poll surveyed 741 likely voters, with a 3.5 percent margin of error. Two other polls in the state, from the American Research Group and Purple Strategies, also showed Obama edging Romney, in each case by two percentage points. A poll released Wednesday by Rasmussen showed the candidates tied. HuffPost Pollster's estimate gives Obama the lead in Ohio by more than two percentage points.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351404274549</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 02:04:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>4</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351405055825-33</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA and his band of TRAITORS</Title><Username>hangatraitor</Username><Timestamp>1351403132074</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 01:45:32 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Google Obama and Penny Pritzker for the Hawaii estate mentioned.

The latest results, released Saturday, show the former Massachusetts governor with a 6-point lead over Obama on the I-4 Corridor. When asked which ticket they would vote for if the general election were held today, 51 percent chose Romney, and 45 percent picked President Obama. The remaining 4 percent said they were still undecided. The telephone survey was conducted Oct. 22–24 among 625 registered Florida voters in the I-4 Corridor. The margin of error is plus-or-minus 4 percent.

The Des Moines Register editorial board endorsed Mitt Romney Saturday night over his rival Barack Obama. The paper endorsed Obama in 2008. Citing Romney's private sector experience and his ability to work across the aisle as governor, the paper decided him best to fix the nation's problems. "Voters should give Mitt Romney a chance to correct the nation's fiscal course and to implode the partisan gridlock that has shackled Washington and the rest of America - with the understanding that he would face the same assessment in four years if he does not succeed," the paper concluded. The paper praised Romney's private sector experience - both as an executive at a hedge fund and running the successful 2002 Salt Lake City Olympics - and commended his plan to encourage growth through lowering taxes, increasing energy production, expanding trade, and balancing the federal budget. Coupled with his term as a Republican governor of blue Massachusetts, where he worked with Democrats to plug budget deficits and pass health care reform, the paper said he was best primed to jump-start the economy. But they warned him not to fall into partisan politics, something they said the president had. "Romney should not squander an opportunity to build consensus in Washington by wasting time on issues that animate many in his party," the paper said, asking Romney not to reverse many civil rights decisions. "We must make it easier for immigrants to come here to live and work legally and stop making criminals of those who are living here lawfully, paying taxes and raising families. The federal government must continue to insist on clean air and water and encourage clean and renewable energy." The paper had kind words for President Obama, crediting him with providing the stimulus at a time when the country teetered on the edge of a depression. But they ultimately decided another term wouldn't provide the boost needed. "The president's best efforts to resuscitate the stumbling economy have fallen short. Nothing indicates it would change with a second term in the White House," the paper wrote. Both candidates desperately sought the paper's endorsement - Romney met with the editorial board at a family farm in Van Meter on October 9. The president had an off the record chat with editors last week, before a public blog post scolding the White House forced them to allow it to be printed. Romney's endorsement is the first for a Republican by the Register since Richard Nixon in 1972.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351424891191</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 07:48:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351425627562-38</Id><Topic><Title>Romney to Win in Florida</Title><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351408426577</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 03:13:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Good morning, dexterphile..seems like your mouth is in gear, but your brain stuck in neutral.

How did he transmit this directive to the military and other agencies? 3.) During the time when Americans were under attack, did the president convene a formal or informal meeting of his national security council? Did the president go to the situation room? 4.) During this time, with which members of the national security team did the president speak directly? 5.) Did Obama speak by phone or teleconference with the combatant commanders who would have sent assistance to the men under attack? 6.) Did he speak with CIA director David Petraeus? 7.) Was the president made aware of the repeated requests for assistance from the men under attack? When and by whom? 8.) Did he issue any directives in response to these requests? 9.) Did the president refuse to authorize an armed drone strike on the attackers? 10.) Did the president refuse to authorize a AC-130 or MC-130 to enter Libyan airspace during the attack?

"Neither the president nor anyone in the White House denied any requests for assistance in Benghazi," National Security Council spokesman Tommy Vietor told Yahoo News by email. Fox News Channel reported Friday that American officials in the compound repeatedly asked for military help during the assault but were rebuffed by CIA higher-ups. At a press briefing one day earlier, Defense Secretary Leon Panetta, asked why there had not been a quicker, more forceful response to the assault, complained of "Monday-morning quarterbacking." Panetta said he and top military commanders had judged it too dangerous to send troops to the eastern Libyan city without a clearer picture of events on the ground. The "basic principle is that you don't deploy forces into harm's way without knowing what's going on; without having some real-time information about what's taking place," he said during a joint question-and-answer session with Chairman of the Joint Chief of Staff General Martin Dempsey. "As a result of not having that kind of information, the commander who was on the ground in that area, General Ham, General Dempsey and I felt very strongly that we could not put forces at risk in that situation," Panetta said. General Carter Ham commands the U.S. Africa Command. And the CIA has denied that anyone in its chain of command rejected requests for help from the besieged Americans. But Weekly Standard Editor Bill Kristol, in a post published Friday, doubted Panetta's explanation and said the fault must lie with Obama himself. "Would the secretary of defense make such a decision on his own? No," Kristol wrote. "It would have been a presidential decision." "He's wrong," said Vietor.</Msg><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351432627827</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 09:57:07 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>8</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351434258296-53</Id><Topic><Title>TIME FOR HOPE AND CHANGE VOTE ROMNEY</Title><Username>romney_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1351378436701</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 18:53:56 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hope that america could survive the leadership that has no lasting values and is for sale to the highest bidder change to 1920's approach to women and all social issues hope that we so not become slaves to the rich change to even more wealth to the rich and even less wealth to all others hope that we do not once again invade a country based on republican lies change to less than min.

Your views are representing the radical left. It is not democracy in action to allow your people to die so that the lawless US dictator wannabe can reclaim his throne in the 2012 election. It is not democracy in action to blame a terrorist attack on a video and contradict the words of the leader of the country that hosted your consulate, who was on the ground and argued that it was a terrorist attack and not a demonstration at all. It is not democracy in action to push out propaganda to your own people, many of whom demonstrate zero wisdom in accepting the false premise and platitudes that the administration didn't know what was going on, or that it was a video, or that they didn't deny support for their ambassador. You give the benefit of the doubt to those who have NEVER earned it. You deny benefit of the doubt to the people who HAVE earned it. You are the opposite of everything you say. You need to understand that there are absolutes in this world. Truth is absolute. You are falling far short of the mark. Wisdom is not being able to articulate the many means of avoiding the truth.

THE DUDE WAS WRONG. Now he is trying to confused low information voters. 3) Here is what he wanted the government to do, that is provide a guarantee, which means if investors give the Auto industry money to stay afloat and something goes wrong, the government will then pay the investors back. The problem with this approach was that investors with the type of money the Auto industry was looking for were all in shock because of the 2008 economic collapse. Nobody was willing to put out money so the industry can stay open so by extension, the government guarantee was meaningless.

After Donald made that announcement, youtube had to stop the huge negative responses by using "Comments are disabled for this video". However, they still kept a score of the "likes and dislikes": Trump's 'Major Announcement' Likes: 25, 521 Dislikes: 64,101 You can guess which side has more popular support! I have more trust is the 'likes and dislikes' polls from youtube... than the Polls about Romney running even and even above President Obama's ratings!</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351460506619</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:41:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351460506813-143</Id><Title>OBAMA WANTS TO PLAY HERO IN A STORM BUT IN AN ACT OF WAR HE LET A REAL HERO TYRONE WOODS GET MURDERED</Title><Msg>ALONG WITH A COURAGEOUS AMBASADOR</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351460506813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:41:46 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351460835847-144</Id><Topic><Title>★★★ Nine days until the Re-Election of President Obama ★★★★ ★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★★</Title><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351457383219</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 16:49:43 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>After Obama is re-elected, what rectal drip alias will you be using?</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351460835847</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:47:15 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351460964279-145</Id><Topic><Title>OBAMA WANTS TO PLAY HERO IN A STORM BUT IN AN ACT OF WAR HE LET A REAL HERO TYRONE WOODS GET MURDERED</Title><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351460506813</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:41:46 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>IMPEACHMENT!!!</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351460964279</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:49:24 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351461000925-146</Id><Topic><Title>The facts on Libya</Title><Username>libertydies30</Username><Timestamp>1351432627827</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 09:57:07 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>fringe right fools have no concept of respect.</Msg><Username>ebonics4gfy</Username><Timestamp>1351461000925</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:50:00 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351461341384-147</Id><Topic><Title>Should Donald Trump ammend the 5 Million dollar deal?</Title><Username>lucifering666</Username><Timestamp>1351207557686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 19:25:57 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>But there are fools out there like lucifering666 who fall for that publicity stunt by the arrogant and big ego Donald Duck... oops Trump!-:)</Msg><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351461341384</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:55:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351461469581-148</Id><Topic><Title>PRESIDENT OBAMA WHY WASN'T THERE SUFFICIENT SECURITY IN BENGHAZI ON 9/11??</Title><Username>romney_rocks</Username><Timestamp>1351380528907</Timestamp><DateTime>Sat, 2012-10-27 19:28:48 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>BECAUSE OBAMA IS A SELF CENTERED FOOL</Msg><Username>whitest_white</Username><Timestamp>1351461469581</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:57:49 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351461717811-149</Id><Title>OBAMA NOBODY BELIEVES THE US MILITARY COULDN'T HAVE DONE SOMETHING IN BENGHAZI</Title><Msg>STOP LYING!!!!!!</Msg><Username>bury_obama</Username><Timestamp>1351461717811</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:01:57 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1351462479580-150</Id><Title>99% of Asian Americans WILL NOT vote Obama !</Title><Msg>I am one of them so I know !</Msg><Username>kingofvietnam</Username><Timestamp>1351462479580</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:14:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351462519256-151</Id><Topic><Title>★★★★ Nine days until the BIGGEST UPSET EVER in a Presidential election, as Romney surges to victory ★★★★</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1351461559674</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 17:59:19 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>FIRST TIME IN HISTORY that a President was reelected in a down economy.

Probably a million living ex-military officers know this like they know 2+2=4. So this Benghazi fiasco is Obama’s baby 100% and there is no way for him to wiggle out. The system is designed to ENSURE that when a crisis is happening, (and a missing ambassador with a consulate under attack in Libya is “Crisis Level Infinity”), and military assets are already charging in to the rescue, the president must be in the loop to grant the the cross-border authorization. Nobody else can do this. This one formality must be followed, “just put your intitials here, Mr. President, for history,” so to speak. Boiler plate, but it must be done. The POTUS has to tell the Sec. State and JCS, “Yes, do it, execute the rescue, cross the borders.” Then it WILL happen, without delay, since the military is already on the way, flying in from all directions toward Benghazi. (Can you imagine Reagan or either Bush saying “No. Cross border permission not granted. Stop the rescue. Stand down.”) But if POTUS says at 5pm DC time, “No military action, no cross border,” and then he becomes “unavailable,” then his last standing order stands until he changes it. So if he went to bed, for example, nobody could change his standing orders. I imagine that a lot of extreme military, CIA and State Dept. craziness was going down while Obama was sleeping. Aircraft must be told proceed, or return to base, or they fall from the sky. I imagine many HEATED arguments around the globe on phone, text and email, subject, “Well wake the damn president up!” Followed by, “I can’t! You MUST stand down the mission!” Just imagine dozens of inbound planes, jets and helos. Ships moving at full speed into position to be “lilypads” for long-range over-water helo refueling. Airborne refueling tankers all head to the area. It’s a complicated ballet. The Pentagon is wide awake, the military is on full alert. The rescue is in process, from the first minutes after the alarm. Everybody in all the planes and involved HQs knows how many minutes/miles to the Libyan border, Benghazi, and their “bingo fuel” moment, when they must turn around or run dry and crash. Ships can “loiter,” but planes fall from the sky. So you can imagine why General Ham of Africom was (if true) relieved for refusing to stand down. He probably KNEW Obama was “unavailable,” and was screaming over the phone, “Well, wake him up, dammit!!” Planes and jets and helicopters and ships and commando teams are zooming all around the central Med, keying in on Benghazi—— And in that environment, OBAMA WAS ASLEEP AND UNREACHABLE!!!!! Resting up for Las Vegas! With a MISSING AMBASSADOR, in Al-Queadatown! No wonder General Ham didn’t want to stop the rescue. He knew the derelict captain was not on the bridge of the ship of state.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1351464228825</Timestamp><DateTime>Sun, 2012-10-28 18:43:48 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1351464271603-161</Id><Topic><Title>The GOP Fumes As Powell Endorses Obama</Title><Username>giovannijay</Username><Timestamp>1351222155550</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2012-10-25 23:29:15 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Oh my what a shock.

Great Jesus was the greatest Progressive of all times. He threw the Wall Street fat cats out of the Temple. Your days are numbered, fringe right. Unlike the Soviets, who failed because they lacked computing power, we do have computers and super computers. We also have corporations. Those who are good citizens and spread the wealth to advance Progress are welcome. The others will be wiped off. Remember, big and strong countries require big and strong governments. The choice is clear in this election. We won't allow the country to be thrown back 50 years.

They had to spend hours scouring used book stores or the back pages of obscure libertarian periodicals to find the great works of Mises, Rothbard, Hayek, and other giants of liberty. Local library and university collections ignored libertarian politics and economics. Today, however, the greatest classics of libertarian thought, libertarian philosophy, and libertarian economics are available instantly to anyone with internet access. Thanks to the internet, it is easier than ever before for liberty activists to spread news and other information regarding the evils of government power and the benefits of freedom. For the first time in human history, supporters of liberty around the world can share information across borders quickly and cheaply. Without the filter of government censors, this information emboldens millions to question governments and promote liberty. This is why liberty-minded Americans must do everything possible to oppose– and stop– government attempts to censor or limit the free flow of information online. One such attempt is known as “CISPA”, or the Cyber Intelligence Sharing and Protection Act. This bill will create a monstrous coalition of big business and big government to rob Americans of their protections under the 4th Amendment of the Constitution. CISPA permits both the federal government and private companies to view your private online communications with no judicial oversight, provided they merely do so in the name of “cybersecurity.” But America is a constitutional republic, not a surveillance state– and the wildly overhyped need for security does not trump the Constitution. “Cybersecurity” is the responsibility of companies that operate and make money in cyberspace, not taxpayers. Those companies should develop market-based private solutions to secure their networks, servers, cloud data centers, and user/customer information. The role of the US intelligence community is to protect the United States from military threats, not to provide corporate welfare to the private sector. Much like the TSA at the airport, CISPA would socialize security costs and remove market incentives for private firms to protect their own investments. Imagine security-cleared agents embedded at private companies to serve as conduits for intelligence information about their customers back to the US intelligence community– while enjoying immunity from any existing civil or criminal laws. Imagine Google or Facebook reporting directly to the National Security Agency about the online activity of US citizens. Imagine US government resources being wasted on a grand scale to “assist” private companies in the global market. All of this would become reality under CISPA. As of this writing, it appears that the House and Senate will not agree on a final version of CISPA this year. However, the Obama administration seems ready to impose provisions of this bill by executive order if Congress does not act soon. The past five years have seen an explosion in the liberty movement, fueled in large part by the internet. Preserving that freedom is crucial if the liberty movement is to continue its progress. Therefore, all activists in the liberty movement have a stake in the battle for internet freedom. We must be ready to come together to fight any attempt to increase government’s power over the internet, regardless of the supposed justifications. We must resist voices from both the political right and left which alternatively seek to legislate morality or enforce political correctness with force. Copyright protection, pornography, cyberterrorism, gambling, and “hate speech” are merely excuses for doing what all governments have done throughout human history: increase their size, scope, and power. Once we understand this, we understand the critical link between internet freedom and human freedom.

Thus, voters daily hear that Mitt Romney is a felon, has neglected to pay taxes for 10 years and gives people cancer. Simultaneously, Obama bribes every group he can, wooing female voters by ridiculously conjuring up a Republican “war on women,” endearing himself to homosexuals by embracing same-sex marriage, making an audacious play for Hispanic votes with his surprise amnesty edict – an executive action he himself previously claimed would be illegal, alluring college students with promises of student-loan rate extensions, homeowners with mortgage aid programs, union member exemptions from Obamacare requirements, and on and on. But to put himself over the top – to capture that last few percent of votes necessary to win a close election – Obama needs one more voting bloc on his side. That would be the shadow group comprised of non-citizens, illegal aliens, repeat-voters, multiple-state-voters, dead people, felons and others ineligible to vote but who will vote anyway – for Obama. To help this last “constituency,” Obama’s administration is currently engaged in what can reasonably be called a massive nationwide campaign to enable voter fraud. The current issue of Whistleblower magazine, which I serve as editor, tells the whole insane story – but don’t read it if you have a heart condition. However, what I want to focus on here is without doubt the most despicable tactic the Obama camp has yet pursued in its efforts to stay in power through tampering with America’s hallowed election system. I’m talking about something even more outrageous than the Holder “Justice Department” attempting to block states from enforcing Voter ID requirements or purging dead people from their voter rolls – and even more corrupt than the left’s ACORN-style “swamping” of election officials with thousands of new (and often bogus) voter registrations at the very last minute and their national campaigns soliciting foreigners to vote. As you may know, last month the Obama re-election campaign sued Ohio state officials in an attempt to suppress, in that pivotal swing state, the votes of America’s military men and women – people who traditionally lean conservative and vote Republican. (CNN exit polling data from 2008 show voters favored Republican John McCain over Obama by a 10-point margin, 54 to 44 percent.) Now, the Obama camp vehemently denies any and all suggestions it is suppressing the military vote, claiming it simply wants an even playing field for all. Let’s look at it: Current Ohio law – being challenged in the lawsuit brought by Obama for America, the Democratic National Committee and the Ohio Democratic Party against Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted and the state’s Attorney General Mike DeWine – includes a special provision to allow military voters to cast their ballots during the last three days (Saturday, Sunday, Monday) immediately prior to Election Day. However, according to the Obama lawsuit, Ohio’s special concession to military voters – an acknowledgment of the difficulty soldiers deployed overseas often encounter in trying to get their vote in on time – is “arbitrary” and has “no discernible rational basis.” Remember those words, for as we’ll soon see they are the key to understanding this grand deception. Because the Ohio situation is somewhat complex and involves several different bills and a bit of recent legislative history, I will only touch on the highlights, but will commend to you a good RedState blog posting if you’re up for an in-depth, play-by-play review of the relevant Ohio voting laws. However, beyond a few right-thinking bloggers, reporters and talk-show hosts, the vast, perpetually mesmerized pro-Obama media – and even the establishment’s arbiters of All Truth On The Internet, Snopes, Politifact and FactCheck – side with Obama and characterize as “shameful” the comments made by the Romney campaign and the few analysts who see the Obama lawsuit for what it is – an attempt to restrict military voting. Indeed, the elite press currently overflows with articles accusing those claiming the Ohio lawsuit is bad for the military of being both wrong and dishonest. Really? Is that why no fewer than 15 military organizations have joined together to fight this particular Obama-machine lawsuit in court? I’m talking about: The National Guard Association of the United States The Association of the U.S. Army The Association of the U.S. Navy The Marine Corps League The Military Officers Association of America The Reserve Officers Association The National Association of the Uniformed Services The Non Commissioned Officers Association of the U.S.A. The Army Reserve Association The Fleet Reserve Association The Special Forces Association The U.S. Army Ranger Association, Inc. AMVETS The National Defense Committee The Military Order of the World Wars Are America’s armed forces wrong and dishonest? Do the Army, Navy and Marine organizations listed above not understand the issues of military voting as thoroughly as the experts at Snopes and Media Matters? Are the Special Forces and Army Ranger groups just plain dumb? Or – is it just possible our military knows something about military voting that Obama and his sleazy lawyers don’t know? Yes, “sleazy.” The lead counsel on this case is none other than Robert Bauer, who author/analyst Matthew Vadum reminds us, “asked the Department of Justice to prosecute Obama critics and fine television stations for daring to carry an ad about Obama’s close personal friendship with Weather Underground terrorist Bill Ayers. Bauer, Obama’s former White House Counsel, is married to Anita Dunn, the Mao-loving former director of communications in the Obama White House. Bauer has been instrumental in whitewashing Obama’s radical roots by filing lawsuits keeping a bewildering array of the president’s personal papers hidden away.” Should Team Obama prevail in the Ohio lawsuit, there are several possible outcomes: The judge could overrule Ohio’s Legislature and governor and resolve the issue by eliminating the three extra voting days for everyone, including military voters – something even the plaintiffs concede could be the result. That would hurt our soldiers. Or the judge could overrule the Ohio government, but impose the opposite remedy, forcing all voting precincts in the state to stay open all three days prior to Election Day for all voters in the state, not just military voters. That would also hurt our soldiers. What?, you may ask. How could everybody, including the military, having three more days to vote hurt our soldiers? Indeed, “what’s the matter with everybody having three extra days to vote?” is the current establishment refrain, its purveyors claiming incorrectly that all Ohio voters used to have those same three days for early voting. They didn’t: Although state law allowed it, local election authorities could decide if they wanted to implement early voting or not. Only “six counties had weekend voting and extended hours and 82 of them didn’t,” lead defendant and Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted told the Associated Press. And why was that? Husted explained, in a Bloomberg Businessweek interview, that setting limits on early voting for most Ohioans – other than the relatively few in the armed forces – is necessary so Ohio’s election boards can synchronize the early balloting records with those at 9,800 polling places to prevent voter fraud, i.e., people voting more than once. And as Ohio’s state GOP chairman, Bob Bennett, said in a written statement: “Nobody is being disenfranchised here, as Ohio’s voters who choose to vote early can do so by mail 24 hours a day, seven days a week or at early voting polls.” The REAL issue at stake here, the one virtually no one is talking about, and the reason it hurts the military if the judge forces Ohio to open all its polling places for all voters for the final three days, is the legal precedent that will be set – namely, that our soldiers cannot constitutionally be given a break, a few extra days, to get their votes in. Friends, you can’t obtain “reasonable results” through abominable means and then call it good. (That would be like me robbing a bank and then going home and saying, “Dear, I made a lot of money today.”) The price America will pay to obtain in Ohio a totally unnecessary “three extra days for everybody to vote” (if the judge rules the way Obama for America is asking it to rule) is the creation of a new legal precedent that it is unconstitutional to give any special consideration to military voters. After all, that is precisely the plaintiffs’ legal argument. But as the Ohio defendants’ legal response points out so eloquently, America has always made special concessions for its soldiers to assure their opportunity to vote, going back to the Revolutionary War. “Unfortunately,” argue lawyers for the Ohio defendants, “throughout history military personnel have been prevented from … [exercising their right to the franchise] due to both procedural and logistic hurdles, resulting in their franchise being effectively ‘hollow.’” They explain: The problem of how to allow those serving in the United States Military to cast a ballot has been with us since the time of our nation’s war for independence. Dating as far back as the Civil War, President Lincoln issued an executive order declaring a cessation of military operations in order to allow military personnel to travel home so that they could cast their ballots. In order to make sure that those serving in the Civil War had access to the franchise, many states authorized elections officials to travel to units in the field to set up polling locations and to collect ballots from soldiers. Military voters – the shocking truth Putting aside arguments pro and con, is there or is there not a serious problem in today’s America with active-duty members of the armed forces having enough time to vote? Here’s a one-question quiz: During the 2010 election, what percentage of America’s military and overseas voters do you think were able to cast a vote that actually counted in the election results? If you guessed “5 percent,” you’re too high. “Tens of thousands of service members’ votes not counted” was the headline of a June 27, 2012, McClatchy newspaper article detailing just how seriously flawed the current system is for enabling the millions of men and woman in the U.S. military to vote. The story includes the following shocking statistics: In 2010, of the approximately 2 million military and overseas voters accounted for in data reported by the states to the Election Assistance Commission, only 4.6 percent of those voters were able to cast an absentee ballot that counted, according to the Military Voter Protection Project’s analysis of that data from the federal Election Assistance Commission, which tracks participation in voting. That compared with 5.5 percent in 2006, which was also a midterm election, the organization concluded. The overall national voter participation rate for the 2010 election was 41.6 percent, authorities said. According to that report, Ohio Secretary of State Jon Husted – yes, the same Jon Husted being sued by Obama for America – was so disgusted he told county election boards “it would be considered grounds for removal of board members if their agencies should fail to electronically send out absentee ballots 45 days prior to an election” to all military voters who requested one. Maybe Team Obama didn’t like Ohio’s zeal to make sure our brave soldiers get to vote along with all the illegal aliens, dead people and others the left is so eager to have vote “early and often” this November. It’s the same thing every election This problem is not new. Ever since the Bush-Gore Florida recount in 2000, every election cycle has brought with it controversy over the counting of overseas military votes – which traditionally lean Republican. Two weeks after Election Day 2000, Mark Herron, a Democrat lawyer in Florida, circulated a memo to members of his party throughout the state instructing them on how to disqualify overseas military ballots. The entire five-page memo, obtained and published by the Drudge Report, included tips on how to lodge protests against military ballots which were thought to heavily favor Republican George W. Bush. Gen. Norman Schwarzkopf, who commanded the Coalition Forces in the 1991 Persian Gulf War, led widespread condemnation of the Democrat memo, saying: “It is a very sad day in our country when the men and women of the armed forces are serving abroad and facing danger of a daily basis … and are denied the right to vote for the president of the United States who will be their commander in chief.” Thousands of overseas military members registered to vote in Florida complained that they either never received requested absentee ballots, the ballots arrived too late or their votes were rejected. In an election won by Bush by just 537 votes, Florida officials had disqualified 1,527 military votes for lack of a postmark. In 2004, the same sorts of complaints arose. And in 2008, legal complaints, news stories and studies showed dozens of states failing to allow soldiers enough time to vote. Then in 2010, ex-DOJ attorney M. Eric Eversole spoke out against the Obama Justice Department for its failure to safeguard the military vote. Although Congress had passed in 2009 a law mandating that military personnel overseas be given sufficient time to participate in U.S. elections, the DOJ’s Voting Section was ignoring the new laws, potentially allowing thousands of uncounted ballots to fall through the cracks, said Eversole, a former litigation attorney for the DOJ Voting Section. And according to a 2009 Pew Center report, more than one-third of states did not provide military voters stationed abroad enough time to vote or were at high risk of not providing enough time. The study found six states provided time to vote only if their military personnel overseas return completed absentee ballots by fax or email – a practice with privacy and security vulnerabilities. Although current law requires that absentee ballots be shipped to military voters overseas a minimum of 45 days prior to Election Day, Eversole said in a Washington Times column that tens of thousands of soldiers received their ballots too late to ensure their votes could be counted in 2010. After the 2010 midterm elections, the U.S. Election Assistance Commission released data showing less than half of the 119,000 overseas military votes cast were counted. Leftists are masters of projection; they reflexively accuse others of the evil they themselves commit. So when Occupy protesters display widespread anti-Semitism, rape women and defecate on police cars, the leftist media ignore it and accuse tea partiers of similar misbehavior, utterly without evidence. In the same way, while leftist-engineered vote fraud is a genuine problem in today’s America, the left denies it and instead projects its guilt onto Republicans with indignant cries of “voter suppression” in response to the most mild and reasonable attempts on the part of state officials to identify who people are before they vote. Yet there is one form of voter suppression that is real and vexing. It is being perpetrated by the left. And its target is the one group that deserves, more than you or me or anyone else in America, to be able to vote for our next commander in chief. And that’s our fighting men and women.
