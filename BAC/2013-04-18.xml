I never tested my safe so I put my money in a shoe boxes and then set small tomato size water balloons on top of my stacks of paper money. My thinking is that if the safe which claims to be fire-proof and is made in America fails, then my water balloons will heat and break thus soaking my worthless paper money and keeping it from burning. Any in sight on this idea or is it that my paper dollars are not worth saving. BTW it would cost me more in gas to drive to the bank and back then they would pay in interest so that's why I don't see the point in putting my money there in there bank. Any positive comments on my water balloon solution would be much appreciated. Thanks for your time friends.</Msg><Username>pubtalked</Username><Timestamp>1366263018388</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 01:30:18 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366263694449-3</Id><Title>Another city bites the dust.

Ice-out was officially declared yesterday at Lake Winnipesaukee, but that only means it's safe for the Mt. Washington ferry to leave its winter mooring in Centre Harbor and make the run down to Wolfeboro and Meredith. I assure you that it will encounter more than a few ice cubes en route. And what's with all this fly-fishing nonsense? ROTFLMAO naturally, being the Renaissance Man that I am, I'm a skilled fly-fisherman, but that sort of tackle impresses spectators far more than it impress the fish or The Fish. Besides, there were no paparazzi in attendance, probably busy stalking the Hub's hospitals and snagging candid shots of bombing victims.</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1366291520285</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 09:25:20 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366291558906-40</Id><Topic><Title>WFC misses by 8 cents and gets happy headlines</Title><Username>joseph.taylor87</Username><Timestamp>1366288300031</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 08:31:40 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I noticed that too.

My point in this analysis is not that a company's past performance is some kind of guarantee of its future results. What I mean by all of this is that when investing for long term, investors tend to think of how well their stocks "could" perform if everything goes well. You also need to assume that economic conditions won't always be the best, and it is worth something if a company has a history of surviving, or even thriving during the bad times.</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1366295801780</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:36:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366295849028-92</Id><Title>GASL--nat gas on a rip</Title><Msg>huge oppt long term---Buy GASL</Msg><Username>shortburner2013</Username><Timestamp>1366295849028</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:37:29 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366295851540-93</Id><Topic><Title>Obama threatens to veto Republican bill to shut down labor board</Title><Username>dumpobamie</Username><Timestamp>1366295297422</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 10:28:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>100% correct.

I'm a short term investor by nature, but I'm holding this puppy until it gets to 25 at least. The last time I bought a stock for the long term was LVS around two bucks and have recently gone long RAD. As far as Whitney is concerned, her comments made in December mentioned a 6-9 month wait for the big move. A good number of other reputable financial investors are very bullish over the next few years as well. Just hang tough.

As such, they tend to be the companies most widely invested in by investors who are in it for the long haul. I am a firm believer in carefully examining a company's past performance, in order to see how they have created value for their shareholders in the past, both in increased share price and increased dividend payouts over time. Particularly, I am interested in how companies have "weathered the storm" during the tough times. I think we can all agree that the past six years (since late 2007) have been a pretty rough time to be an investor in stocks. In examining the Dow components, I got to thinking how investors who bought and held some of these companies through the tough times made out. So, I back tested all 30 stocks, assuming an investment of $10,000 made exactly five years ago. I also assumed that all dividends were reinvested in additional shares. Some of the results are to be expected, and some were downright surprising. Here are the results, in order, and then some comments on the list: (Click to enlarge) As you can see, there is a huge difference between the high performers and low performers. One interesting note is that all but the lowest 8 are worth more now than they were in late 2007. So what do we do now? One thing not to do now is assume that the laggards are "cheap", simply because they are less expensive than they were five years ago. Take Bank of America (BAC) for instance. It isn't cheap, it's diluted. General Electric (GE) had its hands in subprime mortgages, so a lot of the value it had five years ago wasn't real. However, there are some bargains to be had. Hewlett Packard (HPQ) is in the middle of re-inventing itself. If it can start producing innovative new products the way it used to, HP is a real bargain at these levels. The company has said it plans to turn itself around by 2014. Plus, you get paid a 3.67% dividend in the meantime, just for waiting. Home Depot (HD), the number one stock on the list, actually benefited from the recession. During the boom years, houses were going up extremely fast, and some were being built at substandard quality to make the building process move quicker. As a result, these houses needed to be repaired and maintained. Not to mention the amount of foreclosed properties sold that needed major work. As the housing market recovers, and banks continue to unload distressed properties, the repairs will continue, and so will Home Depot's profits. McDonald's (MCD) benefited similar from the recession. Consumers who were used to more expensive dining-out were forced to cut costs and seek less costly alternatives. As a result, to accommodate these new customers, McDonald's has added a whole bunch of healthy options and higher-end foods to its menu. Now with the economy recovering, these customers are still buying. The more "budget-conscious" consumers that McDonald's has catered to for decades also has more disposable income. Add in the fact that McDonald's has been aggressively expanding into emerging markets, and this stock is a buy, despite its gains over the past few years. My point in this analysis is not that a company's past performance is some kind of guarantee of its future results. What I mean by all of this is that when investing for long term, investors tend to think of how well their stocks "could" perform if everything goes well. You also need to assume that economic conditions won't always be the best, and it is worth something if a company has a history of surviving, or even thriving during the bad times. companies in the world. As such, they tend to be the companies most widely invested in by investors who are in it for the long haul. I am a firm believer in carefully examining a company's past performance, in order to see how they have created value for their shareholders in the past, both in increased share price and increased dividend payouts over time. Particularly, I am interested in how companies have "weathered the storm" during the tough times. I think we can all agree that the past six years (since late 2007) have been a pretty rough time to be an investor in stocks. In examining the Dow components, I got to thinking how investors who bought and held some of these companies through the tough times made out. So, I back tested all 30 stocks, assuming an investment of $10,000 made exactly five years ago. I also assumed that all dividends were reinvested in additional shares. Some of the results are to be expected, and some were downright surprising. Here are the results, in order, and then some comments on the list: (Click to enlarge) As you can see, there is a huge difference between the high performers and low performers. One interesting note is that all but the lowest 8 are worth more now than they were in late 2007. So what do we do now? One thing not to do now is assume that the laggards are "cheap", simply because they are less expensive than they were five years ago. Take Bank of America (BAC) for instance. It isn't cheap, it's diluted. General Electric (GE) had its hands in subprime mortgages, so a lot of the value it had five years ago wasn't real. However, there are some bargains to be had. Hewlett Packard (HPQ) is in the middle of re-inventing itself. If it can start producing innovative new products the way it used to, HP is a real bargain at these levels. The company has said it plans to turn itself around by 2014. Plus, you get paid a 3.67% dividend in the meantime, just for waiting. Home Depot (HD), the number one stock on the list, actually benefited from the recession. During the boom years, houses were going up extremely fast, and some were being built at substandard quality to make the building process move quicker. As a result, these houses needed to be repaired and maintained. Not to mention the amount of foreclosed properties sold that needed major work. As the housing market recovers, and banks continue to unload distressed properties, the repairs will continue, and so will Home Depot's profits. McDonald's (MCD) benefited similar from the recession. Consumers who were used to more expensive dining-out were forced to cut costs and seek less costly alternatives. As a result, to accommodate these new customers, McDonald's has added a whole bunch of healthy options and higher-end foods to its menu. Now with the economy recovering, these customers are still buying. The more "budget-conscious" consumers that McDonald's has catered to for decades also has more disposable income. Add in the fact that McDonald's has been aggressively expanding into emerging markets, and this stock is a buy, despite its gains over the past few years. My point in this analysis is not that a company's past performance is some kind of guarantee of its future results. What I mean by all of this is that when investing for long term, investors tend to think of how well their stocks "could" perform if everything goes well. You also need to assume that economic conditions won't always be the best, and it is worth something if a company has a history of surviving, or even thriving during the bad times.</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1366310794067</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:46:34 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366310823801-194</Id><Title>Why do uneducated, inbred white trash stooges glob onto extremist far-right political groups?</Title><Msg>Does it assuage their loser mentality to fester with other life-long loser stooges like the Tea Baggers?</Msg><Username>surreal.deal</Username><Timestamp>1366310823801</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:47:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>16</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>5</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366310842090-195</Id><Topic><Title>TRADERX SAYS THE EUITY PARTY IS OVER!!!</Title><Username>ghostfacetrader</Username><Timestamp>1366228730514</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-04-17 15:58:50 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>No bounce back, huh?</Msg><Username>ghostfacetrader</Username><Timestamp>1366310842090</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:47:22 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366310847158-196</Id><Topic><Title>bac worth $9..</Title><Username>debedus1345</Username><Timestamp>1366308968243</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:16:08 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>book value dosnt matter much .. just because someone put a value on asset does not mean they will get it. its a buyers maket. btw tangible book value is a better metric. bac still needs to settle with MBI and numerous other lawsuits. although the settlement costs are one time, i dont see any meaningfull SP rise till mid2014. my2 cents.</Msg><Username>debedus1345</Username><Timestamp>1366310847158</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:47:27 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366310920169-197</Id><Topic><Title>TraderX.

Killing politicians is a complete waste of time and energy. That's like dealing with a cockroach infestation by running around stepping on them one at a time. Sure, you could hose them down with Raid, or even hire a professional exterminator, and one of you might get lucky and kill them all, but unless and until you figure out how and where they gained access and eliminate that path, they'll be back. Turns out we already know how most of ours are getting in: 95% of our politicians, I mean cockroaches, originated from the boxes of just two brands of breakfast cereal: Lice Kwispies (extra-crunchy granola with Asian cockroaches) and Wheat-Hes (frosted flakes with wingnuts). Both brands are loaded with sugar, full of #$%$, and contain identical amounts of rat feces and toxic chemicals, but duhmasses not only keep buying them; they scream bloody murder if anyone even talks about changing the packages or recipes. Look, it's understandable that many people have stopped buying cereal; I even understand why a few are experimenting with niche brands (what, no German cockroaches with my mucil-ick?). What I don't get is the fierce brand loyalty among consumers. Why aren't they out there firebombing the two biggest cereal manufacturers or suing the pants off them and putting their directors and health inspectors in orange jumpsuits? ROTFLMAO so which is better: binary thinking, or the 2-party system?</Msg><Username>fish2kill</Username><Timestamp>1366316721957</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 16:25:21 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>2</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366316822742-237</Id><Topic><Title>short this pig</Title><Username>blackpearlinvisible</Username><Timestamp>1366313603686</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:33:23 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Hey pearl, BAC has already dropped 8% this week.

Although the bank has doubled over the past year, BAC is still trading three times below its historical average price-to-book ratio. Moreover, earnings continue to increase. EPS is up over 100% this year and expected to grow by more than 30% next year. The recent pullback in BAC was healthy for the stock. BAC still has considerable upside potential, strong fundamentals and catalysts for growth. BAC has a fortress balance sheet and strong cash flow providing the opportunity for additional share buybacks and/or dividend increases in the future. It really amazes me how quickly sentiment changes. Just a few weeks ago, everything was going great and the market hit all-time highs. Here we are couple of weeks into April and the macroeconomic and geopolitical picture has gone from overly bullish to overly bearish in an instant. I'm not buying it. The summer swoon spin-doctors are hard at work. I posit BAC is on track for significant gains. The stock is a solid buy at this level if the U.S. housing market continues to improve. BAC seems poised for solid growth. My target price is $20 within the next twelve months. I see the pullback as a major buying opportunity. You buy a stock for where it is going, not where it has been.</Msg><Username>cchaker</Username><Timestamp>1366319744485</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:15:44 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366319823909-251</Id><Topic><Title>Time to JUMP BACK IN with both feet...BUY NOW FOR RUN UP TO 12</Title><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1366315037178</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:57:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>I think you are right.</Msg><Username>yp_randy_dallas_782</Username><Timestamp>1366319823909</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:17:03 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>3</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Buy</Sentiment></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366320216451-252</Id><Title>help me jesus!</Title><Msg>that it</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1366320216451</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:23:36 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366320311683-253</Id><Topic><Title>Time to JUMP BACK IN with both feet...BUY NOW FOR RUN UP TO 12</Title><Username>greenpoint21</Username><Timestamp>1366315037178</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 15:57:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>need not sell now hold on better days coming!</Msg><Username>ron.wallach</Username><Timestamp>1366320311683</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:25:11 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment>Hold</Sentiment></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366320461898-254</Id><Topic><Title>PE of 45</Title><Username>russ101mos</Username><Timestamp>1366318637313</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 16:57:17 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>That is why BAC had announced a stock buy back. that company can reduce the PE and increase the dividend distribution in the future....Also, more reasons to celebrate the stock price going down, company will get more shares for the buck.....play long investment, will double or triple share value in 12 months</Msg><Username>delljohn70</Username><Timestamp>1366320461898</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 17:27:41 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>2</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366320478345-255</Id><Title>hold on better days coming!

According to Charles Biderman, chairman of TrimTabs Investment Research, “mom and pop” retail investors could be at it again. His firm, among other things, tracks inflows and outflows of cash in the market. As the market pushed to new highs in the first quarter, it appears individuals investors that were trying to ignore the market that once burned them, came back because of the allure of higher returns. “Individuals put money into the market the first 4 months of the year, as they usually do, and not in the last 8 months,” Biderman says, though most of this money flow is for tax-oriented reasons.

Pity yourself, fool.</Msg><Username>obamalipsync</Username><Timestamp>1366336299714</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:51:39 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1366336531385-303</Id><Topic><Title>Will the moronic right-wing perverts ever figure out they are pawns of their 1% masters?</Title><Username>surreal.deal</Username><Timestamp>1366309821448</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 14:30:21 EDT</DateTime></Topic><Msg>You know, I resent your remark. I am the 1%, and I don't control you, because you're a complete idiot and beyond anyone's ability to control. You live in a world of pretend conspiracy when the real conspirators have you shackled to their made-up world and have you spouting their talking points. What you say and what you believe requires no thought and no sensibility. It simply requires the ability to parrot and to suspend brain activity. You are a remarkable success for your handlers. They should be proud of you. Until they decide they don't need you anymore.</Msg><Username>obamalipsync</Username><Timestamp>1366336531385</Timestamp><DateTime>Thu, 2013-04-18 21:55:31 EDT</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1366336834766-304</Id><Title>Oreilly bashed Obama, now what?
