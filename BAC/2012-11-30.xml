Back in the fall of 2009 Cramer when BAC had that year soared back up to 19 dollars and was back down to around 14 or 15 dollars he said BAC would soar up again if they chose Moynihan to replace Lewis. I think he was ticked off and John Paulson hedge fund was not happy with the settle settle settle attitude. I thinkn that's what caused Paulson to get out of BAC and I think Paulson's getting out of BAC was very near the time BAC fell below 10 dollars and somehow keeps this mythical massive looking overhang at 10 dollars. Some shorts are so scared about that void of big resistance between 10 and 15 dollars. Cramer is acting like he is saving face somehow with BALANCING the massive support he once had of Moynihan before Moynihan got the CEO job and Moynihan after getting the job where he began to settle settle settle RATHER THAN STICK TO THE STATED FIGHT HAND TO HAND COMBAT THE LAWSUITS. It is just an opinion.

He isn't eligible for another term so he is not campaigning. He knows how to sway Congress now and it is not by trying to arm twist republican Goose steppers. He has gone to the voters who have more power with them than the party leaders. His power is the people and he is going to use them to stop republican obstructionism.

The Celebrated Mr. W was in Everett Massachusetts the other day touting his grand vision for the former Monsanto chemical site, and his praise for those 30 acres of contaminated marshland makes me think he can overcome my own flattery deficit too. Viewer, are you open to relocation? Here's my sales pitch for Massachusetts: "It's expensive, but the weather sucks." Oh, and I know a good sushi joint. If you're nervous about our first date, how about a double-date? ROTFLMAO I'll bring shutupstellas along to put you more at ease. How's the service sector been treating you? And what breed is Mr. Martinez's dog? There have been some interesting developments in the Staggerwing Saga that have kept me kinda busy lately. Remember the problem I ran into trying to find original longerons for the Beech's damaged fuselage? Well, it turns out that there was a design flaw in the early Staggerwings that made them 'sluggish' about the pitch axis. I thought the thing was supposed to have the delicate pitch response of a cement mixer and liked the way my forearms got all pumped up like Popeye's whenever I flared for landings, although I didn't much care for the tendon-popping I experienced during the Cuban Eight over the Utah Day Care Center. Beech corrected the problem in 1936 and later Staggerwings by lengthening the fuselage a couple of feet aft of the cabin to give the tail assembly control surfaces more leverage, and the FAA issued an airworthiness directive requiring the modification to be incorporated on the earlier models, but somehow the news never caught up with my bird. It's amazing how the threat of a few lawsuits improves one's standing in the community. Flo has started calling me 'Sir' again; the FAA has grudgingly returned my pilot's license (but with a crop-dusting prohibition - apparently they feel the added weight of the tanks and sprayers was a contributor to the accident), and even the boys at the hangar have stopped calling me 'duhmass'. I'm considering suing my wife and daughter for emotional abuse to see if they'll stop calling me bad names too. Gotta go now; Mr. Otis is here to inspect my library elevator. Besides the odor, I'm gonna ask him if he knows why it never went all the way to the top.

Senators might therefore ask Ms. Rice why she was put forward to speak about Benghazi, and what part her personal ambition might have played in her willingness to assume the role known during the Cold War as "useful idiot." Ms. Rice might also be asked what she knew about al Qaeda's operations in Libya. As a member of the U.N. Security Council and its "Al-Qaida Sanctions Committee," she is privy, for example, to information about the al Qaeda-affiliated Libyan Islamic Fighting Group, which is under sanctions and, according to the council, "maintain[s] a presence in eastern Libya." Senators might also explore Ms. Rice's broader record at the U.N. Why, for example, did she think it was appropriate to absent herself from Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's September speech to the General Assembly, the purpose of which was to offer the global community a painstaking explanation of why Iran must be stopped before it can weaponize its growing stock of enriched uranium.</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1354291397743</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 11:03:17 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="TopicMessage"><Id>1354291563347-63</Id><Title>PROTECT YOUR 401K, RETIREMENT, SAVING NOW!!!</Title><Msg>FOR YOUR ?</Msg><Username>rddr2022</Username><Timestamp>1354291563347</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 11:06:03 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354292053157-64</Id><Topic><Title>I hear Mitt Romney is back to stealing retiree pensions !

The reason you see so much volume in BAC and certain other stocks is largely due to HTF (high frequency trading). BAC quite often has a trading range of .40 or more. HTF is driven by computers trading in and out of stocks at speeds only computers can achieve. That means that in a stock like BAC, the shares are being bought and sold over and over again, thus creating high volume. One can mistake that high volume as being driven by supply/demand. Sometimes it is, for example when stocks announce news or earnings. Largely, it is not. It is driven by a day trading mentality. Now, if you look at the volume and trading in and out of stocks at millions of shares a day, the ten or more cents per share one might make adds up to millions of dollars of profit or loss per day.</Msg><Username>joepen12000</Username><Timestamp>1354293712041</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 11:41:52 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354293840642-73</Id><Topic><Title>Once again I wil ask about volume of trading..</Title><Username>joannab3</Username><Timestamp>1354290220490</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 10:43:40 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Stetchlee, you obviously don't know what how the DOW.

However, it seems like BAC is in the news a lot (mostly headlines like today that tell the world that "BAC is one of the most frequently traded stocks"). To that end, don't you think that people (I'm talking about the typical average retail trader who uses online trading for example) reading headlines like that would be tempted to load up on BAC since it's a mere ten bucks per share? (and yes, I know that a stock's price is not really based on PPS, but a lot of average folks don't know that) You would think something like that could be construed as increasing the demand. Obviously I am incorrect.

That might lead people to short the stock more than buy to hold for profit. It also "tints" peoples opinion about the company. Remember, speculators trade based on their perceptions (what they think is going to happen) and their emotions ("I got to get out of this now and take the loss before I lose everything!") And let's face it, BAC mgmt has not missed one opportunity to shoot itself in the foot with negative PR. All of that said, anyone shorting BAC at this time of year is playing with fire and their hands will get burned. Statistically, the time of year that most of the profit on stocks is made is between October and March. That is the period when stocks hit their upsides. In fact, the statics show that if one invests in that time period as opposed to the rest of the year, over a 25 year period one's returns would be something like 10 times greater. Yes, there are exceptions to every rule, but that is a long standing and accurate statistic for many reasons, which I won't go into here. Now, with the advent of the internet, everything changed for the stock market, and especially the small retail speculator. Now, excluding insider knowlege, the small retail speculator (I think the term investing where stocks are concerned is now an oxymoron), has access to the same info and reaction times as big institutional investors. If I were advising someone today who was already a shareholder of BAC, that advice would be to wait until the 1/17 Q4 earnings call.Baring horrific economic news (which I don't see happening) I believe that by the middle of January, we will see this stock much closer to 15. Remember, it has a book value of almost 20 per share and an intrinsic value somewhere around 13. BAC has announced that it will hold its earnings call prior to market open, which is usually an indication of good news. My advice to those not in it at this point would be to play the Feb call options. Any downside position taken at this point might yield a small profit but will pale in comparison to the upside that is coming this January. Just my opinion.</Msg><Username>blacklaceteddie</Username><Timestamp>1354301036081</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 13:43:56 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>0</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>0</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1354301302910-127</Id><Topic><Title>BAC seems to be following the general market</Title><Username>stretchlee2000</Username><Timestamp>1354290238970</Timestamp><DateTime>Fri, 2012-11-30 10:43:58 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Tom: you are the scam and fraud.

The President is the LEADER of the country, not Boo-hoo Boehner, who can advise and strike for compromise but MUST NOT HOLD THE COUNTRY HOSTAGE TO HIS DICTATORIAL DEMANDS. Boehner's continued instransigence, which has persisted year after year, unnecessarily dragging down the country's economy and putting US citizens through nightmarish conditions in addition to dramatically weakening the US' prosperity and position in the world, both now and far into the future, amounts to USURPATION of power of this country.

The trump card the republicans have is that the debt ceiling will not be lifted and that will force domestic programs to be cut. Allowing the tax rates to go up will cause millions of jobs to be lost and thousands of small businesses to shut down. In turn, tax revenues will go down. This happens everytime tax rates go up. So, Geitner or his sucessor will have some revenue and will then need to determine which programs get funded and which don't. The net result of Obama's hubris wil be an awful economy and millions of losers on the government dole getting much less support.
