Body count: In the last six months 292 killed (murdered) in Chicago. 221 killed in Iraq AND Chicago has one of the strictest gun laws in the entire US. President: Barack Hussein Obama Senator: #$%$ Durbin House Representative: Jesse Jackson Jr. Governor: Pat Quinn House leader: Mike Madigan Atty. Gen.: Lisa Madigan (daughter of Mike) Mayor: Rahm Emanuel The leadership in Illinois - all Democrats. Thank you for the combat zone in Chicago . Of course, they're all blaming each other because there aren't any Republicans elected to blame. Chicago school system rated one of the worst in the country. Can't blame Republicans; there aren't any! State pension fund $78 Billion in debt, worst in country. Can't blame Republicans; there aren't any! Cook County ( Chicago ) sales tax 10.25% highest in country. Can't blame Republicans; there aren't any! This is the political culture that Obama comes from in Illinois. And he is going to 'fix' Washington politics for us??? George Ryan is no longer Governor, he is in the big house. Of course he was replaced by Rob Blajegovitch who is...that's right, also in the big house. And Representative Jesse Jackson Jr. resigned a couple of weeks ago. That is because he is fighting being sent to...that's right, the big house. The Land of Lincoln, where our governors make our license plates. But you know what? As long as they keep providing entitlements to the population of Chicago,nothing is going to change, except the state will go broke before the country does.

The report also criticized the Treasury for lacking a plan to unwind its investment in Ally. Taxpayers own 74 percent of the company.

NO SURPRISE. VOTERS WILL REGRET THE DAY THE VOTED FOR OBAMA</Title><Msg>The Commerce Department said Wednesday that the economy contracted at an annual rate of 0.1 percent in the fourth quarter. That's a sharp slowdown from the 3.1 percent growth rate in the July-September quarter. The surprise contraction could raise fears about the economy's ability to handle tax increases that took effect in January and looming spending cuts.</Msg><Username>purebred_red</Username><Timestamp>1359557030773</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 09:43:50 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>7</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>3</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359557113295-36</Id><Topic><Title>MAKE UP YOUR MIND VOTERS MARCO RUBIO OR POTATOE WITH LEGS</Title><Username>obamaless</Username><Timestamp>1359498663083</Timestamp><DateTime>Tue, 2013-01-29 17:31:03 EST</DateTime></Topic><Msg>Let me guess.

Chicago Mayor Rahm Emanuel, a former Obama White House chief of staff, has made the same commitment and gone a step further. Emanuel has authored letters to Bank of America and TD Bank because they maintain multimillion-dollar lines of credit for major gun manufacturers. In the letters, Emanuel urges the banks to use their influence to "push" the manufacturers to go along with the president's tough new gun controls. Lawrence Keane, general counsel for the National Shooting Sports Foundation, responded: "It's classic Rahm Emanuel Chicago politics -- try to bully and pressure our industry into somehow agreeing with the proposals that are being advanced by antigun mayors like him."</Msg><Username>oh_mama_say_it_aint_so</Username><Timestamp>1359560354428</Timestamp><DateTime>Wed, 2013-01-30 10:39:14 EST</DateTime><ThumbUp>1</ThumbUp><ThumbDown>1</ThumbDown><Sentiment/></Message><Message type="ReplyMessage"><Id>1359560384284-61</Id><Topic><Title>AMERICANS CHOSE OBAMA OVER YOU RETARDED INBRED TEABAGGERS !

He has accelerated his bullishness on big financial institutions, predicting an unbridled 14-year run higher for banking stocks. The former Rochdale Securities analyst met the media Wednesday for the first time since switching over to Rafferty Capital Markets, a small player in the field but one where he said he feels comfortable to continue his often outspoken analysis. Rochdale collapsed after a rogue trader in late 2012 brought the firm down. Following a year in which financials led the stock market higher, Bove said the industry is now in a position to continue that leadership role and reward investors who got hammered during the financial crisis.

Among his top picks are Goldman Sachs (GS), Bank of America (BAC), JPMorgan Chase (JPM) and Citigroup (NYSE:C).

I just enjoy tormenting far right fools like you because I know how much you seethe with rage knowing Obama is YOUR president, AND will continue on as YOUR president for four more years.

That is why the informed and intelligent voters turned out in record numbers to flush the filth you promote back to the cesspool where it spawned.
